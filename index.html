Using her Seer abilities, Kerena tries to locate the fabled Incarnations of Immortality, seeking their aid in removing the taint from her baby.

Known &#x201c;without affection&#x201d; to members of the boss&#x2019;s crew as &#x201c;Big Country&#x201d; on account of his long hair, beard, and cowboy boots, Roy is alert to the possibility that a routine assignment could be a deathtrap. Which it is. Yet what the would-be killers do to Roy Cady is not the same as what he does to them, which is to say that after a smoking spasm of violence, they are mostly dead and he is mostly alive.</p><p>Before Roy makes his getaway, he realizes there are two women in the apartment, one of them still breathing, and he sees something in her frightened, defiant eyes that causes a fateful decision. He takes her with him as he goes on the run from New Orleans to Galveston, Texas&#x2014;an action as ill-advised as it is inescapable. The girl&#x2019;s name is Rocky, and she is too young, too tough, too sexy&#x2014;and far too much trouble. Roy, Rocky, and her sister hide in the battered seascape of Galveston&#x2019;s country-western bars and fleabag hotels, a world of treacherous drifters, pickup trucks, and ashed-out hopes. Any chance that they will find safety there is soon lost. Rocky is a girl with quite a story to tell, one that will pursue and damage Roy for a very long time to come in this powerful and atmospheric thriller, impossible to put down. Constructed with maximum tension and haunting aftereffect, written in darkly beautiful prose, <i>Galveston </i>announces the arrival of a major new literary talent.</p></p><p>Nic Pizzolatto's fiction has appeared in The Atlantic, The Oxford American, The Missouri Review, The Iowa Review, Best American Mystery Stories and other publications. His work has been a finalist for the National Magazine Award, and his story collection <i>Between Here and the Yellow Sea </i>was named by Poets &amp; Writer&#x2019;s Magazine as one of the top five fiction debuts of the year. He lives in Indiana.Michael Kramer narrates in a flat, remote tone, a clear decision on his part to emphasize the noirish tone of Pizzolatto&#39;s novel about a hard man who unexpectedly finds himself with altruistic feelings toward a troubled young woman. And certainly no one can fault Kramer for that choice--or with anything at all about his intelligent and nuanced performance. The question is really larger than the performance, and that is whether noir has reached the point of clich�. That, of course, is a personal choice. If yes, then Kramer&#39;s detached air will be immediately grating. If no, then sit back and enjoy a gifted actor.

In this whimsical satire, Singer mocks the 'advantages'-such as war, crime, and revolution-that civilization brings to Chelm." --<i>Booklist</i><br></p><h2>The Oxford Companion to Food 2nd Ed</h2><p>Twenty years in the making, the first edition of Alan Davidson's <em>magnum opus</em> appeared in 1999 to worldwide acclaim. Its combination of serious food history, culinary expertise, and entertaining serendipity was recognized as utterly unique. Including both an exhaustive catalogue of the foods that nourish humankind-fruit from tropical forests, mosses scraped from adamantine granite in Siberian wastes, or ears, eyeballs and testicles from a menagerie of animals-and a richly allusive commentary on the culture of food, whether expressed in literature and cookbooks, or as dishes peculiar to a country or community, the <em>Oxford Companion to Food</em> immediately found distinction.<br> <br> The study of food and food history was a new discipline at the time, but one that has developed exponentially in the years since. There are now university departments, international societies, and academic journals, in addition to a wide range of popular literature exploring the meaning of food in the daily lives of people around the world.<br> <br> Alan Davidson famously wrote eighty percent of the first edition, which was praised for its wit as well as its wisdom. Tom Jaine, the editor of the second edition, worked closely with Jane Davidson and Helen Saberi to ensure that new contributions continue in the same style. The result is an expanded volume that remains faithful to Davidson's peerless work. The text has been updated where necessary to keep pace with a rapidly changing subject, and Jaine assiduously alerts readers to new avenues in food studies. Agriculture; archaeology; food in art, film, literature, and music; globalization; neuroanatomy; and the Silk Road are covered for the first time, and absorbing new articles on confetti; cutlery; doggy bags; elephant; myrrh; and potluck have also found their way into the <em>Companion.</em> <br></p><p>Alan Davidson's <i>Oxford Companion to Food</i> has been over 20 years in the assembling, but here it is; and it is superlatively worth the wait. In fact, superlatives fall silent. A huge and authoritative dictionary of 2,650 entries on just about every conceivable foodstuff, seasoning, cuisine, cooking method, historical survey, significant personage, and explication of myth, it is supplemented by some 40 longer articles on key items. Davidson himself (no relation to this reviewer) contributes approximately 80 percent of the 2,650 entries, thereby guaranteeing high levels of erudition, readability, and deadpan feline wit. Since this is a monument intended to last, nothing so frivolous as a recipe is included. A decision taken early in the development of the project to abjure issues whose significance is largely topical has also ensured an agreeable high-mindedness--nothing on those crucial but essentially dreary topics of BSE and GM foods, for example.<p> If a fault could be found, it would only be that it's often difficult to read to the end of an entry, as the abundant cross-referencing all too easily sends one off to another entry, thence bouncing off to another, and all too soon the original is forgotten. A random alphabet of seductions might include: Aardvark, Botulism, Cup Cake, David (Elizabeth), Enzymes, Fat-Tailed Sheep, Gender/Sex and Food, Hallucinogenic Mushrooms, Ice Cream Sundae, Jewish Dietary Laws, Kangaroos, Lobscouse, Microwave Cooking, Norway, Offal, Puffin, Queen of Puddings, Roti, Scurvy, Termite Heap Mushroom (or Taillevant), Umeboshi, Vegetarianism, Washing up (a very elegant little article), sadly no X, Yin-yang, and Zabaglione. As this might show, Alan Davidson's aim, borrowed from Dumas's great <i>Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine</i>, that his work would appeal not only to persons of "serious character" but also those "of a much lighter disposition," is utterly fulfilled. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br><strong>Alan Davidson</strong> was a distinguished author and publisher, and one of the world's best-known writers on fish and fish cookery. In 1975 he retired early from the diplomatic serivice - after serving in, among other places, Washington, Egypt, Tunisia, and Laos, where he was British Ambassador - to pursue a fruitful second career as a food historian and food writer extraordinaire. Among his popular books are <em>North Atlantic Seafood</em> and <em>Mediterrranean Seafood</em>. In 2003, shortly before his death, he was awarded the Erasmus Prize for his contribution to European culture. <strong>Tom Jaine</strong> is an independent writer and publisher, specializing in food and food history. He is the author of numerous books, including <em>Cooking in the Country</em>, <em>Making Bread at Home</em>, and <em>Traditional Country House Cooking</em>. He frequently writes for <em>The Times</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, the <em>Sunday Telegraph</em>, the <em>Evening Standard</em>, and many magazines and journals. He was editor of <em>The Good Food Guide</em> from 1989 to 1994, has presented 'The Food Programme' on Radio 4, and has frequently participated in discussions of food on radio and television. <strong>Jane Davidson</strong> is Alan Davidson's widow, and assisted him in his work, in particular as co-author of <em>Dumas on Food</em>. She has written many reviews of food books for <em>Petits Propos Culinaires</em>. She has also worked for the British Council. <strong>Helen Saberi</strong> was Alan Davidson's personal assistant, and worked very closely with him on the first edition of the Companion, as contributor, researcher, fact-checker, and proofreader. She is co-author with Alan Davidson of <em>Trifle</em> and <em>The Wilder Shores of Gastronomy</em>.<br></p><h2>Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story</h2><p>The author recounts how she and her husband founded the Mattel Toy company, discusses her bout with breast cancer, and describes the breast prosthesis company she subsequently started</p><p>The history of Barbie, created by Handler and her husband Elliot, cofounders of Mattel Toys, is recounted here. The doll, which was "born" in 1959 and whose "big boobs" aroused controversy at the time, enjoyed such commercial success that the market was expanded to include her boyfriend, Ken, siblings and friends-all with their own wardrobes and accessories. Assisted by Shannon (Why It's Great to Be a Girl), Handler also bitterly recalls her 1970 mastectomy and forced resignation from Mattel in 1975, after she was indicted for preparing false financial records. Though she denied her guilt, in 1978, she entered a plea of nolo contendere because, she says, she did not want to "jeopardize" her latest commercial venture after leaving Mattel-a breast prosthesis business. This self-serving memoir reclaims Handler's "motherhood" of Barbie.

He served at Marathon against Darius in 490, and again during Xerxes' invasion, 480&#x2013;479. Between 478 and 467 he visited Sicily, there composing by request <i>Women of Aetna.</i> At Athens he competed in production of plays more than twenty times, and was rewarded on at least thirteen occasions, becoming dominant between 500 and 458 through the splendour of his language and his dramatic conceptions and technique.</p><p> Of his total of 80&#x2013;90 plays seven survive complete. The <i>Persians</i> (472), the only surviving Greek historical drama, presents the failure of Xerxes to conquer Greece. <i>Seven against Thebes</i> (467) was the second play of its trilogy of related plays on the evil fate of the Theban House. Polyneices tries to regain Thebes from his brother Eteocles; both are killed. In <i>Suppliant Maidens</i>, the first in a trilogy, the daughters of Danaus arrive with him at Argos, whose King and people save them from the wooing of the sons of their uncle Aegyptus. In <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, first or second play of its trilogy about Prometheus, he is nailed to a crag, by order of Zeus, for stealing fire from heaven for men. Defiant after visitors' sympathy and despite advice, he descends in lightning and thunder to Hell. The Oresteia (458), on the House of Atreus, is the only Greek trilogy surviving complete. In <i>Agamemnon</i>, the King returns from Troy, and is murdered by his wife Clytaemnestra. In <i>Libation-Bearers</i>, Orestes with his sister avenges their father Agamemnon's death by counter-murder. In <i>Eumenides</i>, Orestes, harassed by avenging Furies, is arraigned by them at Athens for matricide. Tried by a court set up by Athena, he is absolved, but the Furies are pacified.</p><p> We publish in Volume I four plays; and in Volume II the Oresteia and some fragments of lost plays.</p></p><p>Emeritus Regius Professor of Greek, Oxford, <b>Hugh Lloyd-Jones</b> was knighted in 1989.</p><h2>A Terrible Splendor: Three Extraordinary Men, a World Poised for War, and the Greatest Tennis Match Ever Played</h2><p>Before Federer versus Nadal, before Borg versus McEnroe, the greatest tennis match ever played pitted the dominant Don Budge against the seductively handsome Baron Gottfried von Cramm. This deciding 1937 Davis Cup match, played on the hallowed grounds of Wimbledon, was a battle of titans: the world's number one tennis player against the number two; America against Germany; democracy against fascism. For five superhuman sets, the duo&#x2019;s brilliant shotmaking kept the Centre Court crowd&#x2013;and the world&#x2013;spellbound.<br><br>But the match&#x2019;s significance extended well beyond the immaculate grass courts of Wimbledon. Against the backdrop of the Great Depression and the brink of World War II, one man played for the pride of his country while the other played for his life. Budge, the humble hard-working American who would soon become the first man to win all four Grand Slam titles in the same year, vied to keep the Davis Cup out of the hands of the Nazi regime. On the other side of the net, the immensely popular and elegant von Cramm fought Budge point for point knowing that a loss might precipitate his descent into the living hell being constructed behind barbed wire back home.<br><br>Born into an aristocratic family, von Cramm was admired for his devastating good looks as well as his unparalleled sportsmanship. But he harbored a dark secret, one that put him under increasing Gestapo surveillance. And his situation was made even more perilous by his refusal to join the Nazi Party or defend Hitler. Desperately relying on his athletic achievements and the global spotlight to keep him out of the Gestapo&#x2019;s clutches, his strategy was to keep traveling and keep winning. A Davis Cup victory would make him the toast of Germany. A loss might be catastrophic. <br><br>Watching the mesmerizingly intense match from the stands was von Cramm&#x2019;s mentor and all-time tennis superstar Bill Tilden&#x2013;a consummate showman whose double life would run in ironic counterpoint to that of his German pupil.<br><br>Set at a time when sports and politics were inextricably linked, <i>A Terrible Splendor</i> gives readers a courtside seat on that fateful day, moving gracefully between the tennis match for the ages and the dramatic events leading Germany, Britain, and America into global war. A book like no other in its weaving of social significance and athletic spectacle, this soul-stirring account is ultimately a tribute to the strength of the human spirit.</p><p>MARSHALL JON FISHER&#x2019;s work has appeared in <i>The Atlantic, Harper&#x2019;s,</i> and other magazines.

Tennyson&#39;s beautiful and enigmatic poem of unrequited love, set in Arthurian England, has enthralled artists for well over a century. With her luminous illustrations, Genevi?ve C?t? weaves a refreshingly modern interpretation of this beloved poem -- one that will enchant readers of all ages.</p><p>Genevi�ve C?t� is a Montreal artist whose illustrations have graced the pages of publications such as the New York Times and the Boston Globe. Her books have received three nominations for the Governor General&#39;s Award for Illustration, one of which went on to win, and she has also won the the Elisabeth Mrazik-Cleaver Award.Grade 7 Up&#x2013;This lyrical poem, written nearly 200 years ago, has been given new life through C�t�'s intelligent artistry. Tennyson's strict stanzas move back and forth in dialogue with the playful, stylized, mixed-media illustrations. The poem's symbolism has been interpreted variously as a work about the isolation of the artist, the inevitability of death, and unrequited love. The art offers room for readers to wander and wonder within the realm of suggestion. C�t�'s illustrations allow the poem to speak its full range; however, the theme of love is strongly suggested by the depiction of a couple on the opening page glancing over the water to the island where the Lady of Shalott resides alone. Admirably, the art does not depict the Lady of Shalott as a tragic figure; after she declares that she is 'half sick of shadows,' she takes flight from the world of mirrored images as if a butterfly from a chrysalis. The artist's reapers are sinister and humorous; their dark glasses situate them in the modern era. There are industrialized urban centers, bridges, and automobiles. Fans will be born of both Tennyson and C�t�.

It is the story of huge talent and huger ambition, one that probes the sometimes blurred borders dividing art and beauty from truth and humanity. <br><br>Two of Riefenstahl&#x2019;s films, <i>Olympia </i>and <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, are universally regarded as the greatest and most innovative documentaries ever made, but they are also insidious glorifications of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. Now, in this masterful new biography, Steven Bach reveals the truths and lies behind this gifted woman&#x2019;s lifelong self-vindication as an apolitical artist who claimed she knew nothing of the Holocaust and denied her complicity with the criminal regime she both used and sanctified. <br><br>The facts and her actions, many unknown until now, bear chilling witness: her passionate enthusiasm for Hitler from her first reading of <i>Mein Kampf</i>; her involvements with Nazi leaders Joseph Goebbels, Martin Bormann, Albert Speer, and Julius Streicher, who advanced her career, and with Hitler, who personally helped finance it; her role as silent eyewitness to wartime atrocities against Jews; and her use of slave labor in the form of concentration camp Gypsies destined for Auschwitz. We see her after the war trying to sell footage to Hollywood under an alias, manipulating a sham &#x201c;discovery&#x201d; of the Nuba tribes of Sudan into a career comeback, fighting to disinherit her closest living relatives, and&#x2014;to the end&#x2014;unable to express remorse for the millions murdered by the Nazi regime made mythic by her work.<br><br>Relying on new sources&#x2014;including interviews with her colleagues and intimate friends, as well as on previously unknown recordings of Riefenstahl herself&#x2014;Bach gives us an exceptional work of historical investigation that untangles the past and is also an objective but unsparing appraisal of a woman of spectacular gifts corrupted by ruthless personal ambition.</p><p>Steven Bach<b> </b>is the author of two previous biographies, <i>Marlene Dietrich: Life and Legend </i>and <i>Dazzler: The Life and Times of Moss Hart. </i>He was in charge of worldwide production for United Artists, where he was involved in such films as <i>Raging Bull</i>, <i>Manhattan</i>, <i>The French Lieutenant&#x2019;s Woman</i>, and <i>Heaven&#x2019;s Gate</i>, about which he wrote the bestseller <i>Final Cut</i>. He teaches at Bennington College and Columbia University and divides his time between New England and Europe.<b>CHAPTER ONE: METROPOLIS </b><br><i>I want to become something quite great.</i> <br>&#x2014;Leni Riefenstahl <br><br>Leni Riefenstahl created images from light and shadow, from movement, rhythm, passion, prodigious energy, physical courage, and driving, epic ambition. She had, she said, one subject&#x2014;beauty&#x2014;and searched for it in the natural world, mountain high and underwater deep; in the flags and torches of massed multitudes; in the struggle and transcendence of athletic competition; in the physical and erotic perfection of primitive warriors; and&#x2014;from the beginning&#x2014;in herself. <br><br>She was born Helene Amalia Bertha Riefenstahl on August 22, 1902, in Wedding, a sooty workers&#x2019; district on the industrial edges of Berlin. The population of the city was then two million going on four, with growth so rapid that street maps were obsolete before printers could produce them. Disgruntled civic planners disparaged Berlin as a &#x201c;nowhere city,&#x201d; a city &#x201c;always becoming&#x201d; that &#x201c;never is,&#x201d; but advocates of change hailed &#x201c;progress&#x201d; and thrilled to restless urban rhythms as full of expectancy as its air&#x2014;the fabled <i>Berliner Luft</i>&#x2014;and just as vital and intoxicating. <br><br>The onetime river trading post and its mushrooming suburbs would incorporate as Greater Berlin in 1920, by which time the boundaries of &#x201c;Athens on the Spree&#x201d; were vast enough to embrace Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Munich put together. It was a parvenu metropolis compared to Paris, London, or Vienna with their Roman roots and ruins, but it was also&#x2014;quite suddenly&#x2014;the third largest metropolitan area in the world: loud, aggressive, and going places. <br><br>&#x201c;The fastest city in the world!&#x201d; they called Berlin when Leni was born there. It had been the capital of Germany, of what was grandly styled the Second Reich, for only thirty years, but empire builders in a hurry boasted of its modernity, unperturbed that horses still pulled trolleys through gaslit streets, that running water (hot or cold) was seldom encountered above the ground floor, and that the Berlin telephone directory was a twenty-six-page pamphlet. Crime and vice were no more rampant and no less colorful than in London, Paris, Buenos Aires, or New York. News of the day&#x2014;or the minute&#x2014;rolled off the presses in every political persuasion from the hundred dailies and weeklies that were published there in a babel of languages, making Berlin the liveliest, most densely concentrated center of journalism in all Europe. <br><br>Berlin&#x2019;s boosters were too focused on the future to give more than a backward glance to such slums and laborers&#x2019; districts as Wedding or to the workers&#x2019; children, like Leni, growing up in them. Civic do-gooders nodded dutifully as Kaiser Wilhelm II reminded them of &#x201c;the duty to offer to the toiling classes the possibility of elevating themselves to the beautiful.&#x201d; One had only to point inferiors in the direction of the Hohenzollern Palace, the Tiergarten, the Victory Column, the broad canals and their 957 bridges (more than in Venice), the Pergamon Museum with its antiquities, the Reichstag with its &#x201c;To the German People&#x201d; promise carved in stone beneath its sheltering dome of steel and glass; or to the glittering theaters, operas, and hotels, the promenade streets such as tree-canopied Unter den Linden or the racier Kurf�rstendamm (Bismarck&#x2019;s answer to the Champs-�lys�es) lined with shops and sidewalk caf�s. If the toiling class infrequently abandoned the factory floors for tours of the more elegant venues of imperial Berlin, the kaiser graciously imparted his notions of art and the beautiful to them. &#x201c;An art which transgresses the laws and barriers outlined by Me,&#x201d; he explained, &#x201c;ceases to be an art.&#x201d; This rang with reassuring certainty to the aesthetically insecure and was a viewpoint that a later leader&#x2014;a onetime painter of picture postcards and aspiring architect&#x2014;would echo and that millions would accept with awed docility. <br><br>No city in Europe made such a cult of modernity. Berlin was rushing at the turn of the century to make up in future what it lacked in past, while custodians of nostalgia mourned &#x201c;a vanished Arcadia&#x201d; that had never truly been. Velocity, anonymity, and the cheek-by-jowl juxtaposition of promise and peril inspired songs, paintings, novels, plays, and&#x2014;already flickering silently when Leni was born&#x2014;films. Most of these works inspired awe and alienation, too, as ordinary Berliners wondered uneasily where all this urban energy would lead. Ambivalence would find disturbing graphic expression in the 1920s, but prophetic, ominous visions of city life that were dubbed &#x201c;degenerate&#x201d; from the start began appearing in the teens from such painters as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Emil Nolde, and Ludwig Meidner, who labeled his urban paintings &#x201c;apocalyptic landscapes.&#x201d; <br><br>Berlin-Wedding had scant time for art or musings on modernity. It was a dense warren of factories, foundries, and labor. It was blocks of tenements&#x2014;called <i>Mietskaserne</i>, rent barracks&#x2014;crowding blue-collar families into one- or two-room flats stacked five or six stories high around sunless courtyards where life was harsh and suicide a daily occurrence. &#x201c;Tenement sickness&#x201d; was shorthand for tuberculosis and rickets in Berlin, where the infant mortality rate was almost 20 percent when the nineteenth century ended and more than double that in Wedding, where it reached a high of 42 percent just after Leni was delivered there. <br><br>Wedding was poor but not without altruism and aspiration. Its mean streets offered shelter to the homeless in a spartan doss-house, and there was a small pond for ice-skating. Someone in 1905 rented out part of a courtyard shed as a photographer&#x2019;s studio, and it wasn&#x2019;t long before one-reel movies were being shot there. In 1912, Wedding established Berlin&#x2019;s first crematorium to compensate for the scarcity and cost of open burial ground. Children played in courtyards; geraniums grew on windowsills; music and love got made; and by 1918, nearly 40 percent of all Berliners lived in tenement districts like it. We see their faces in the etchings and prints of K�the Kollwitz; their bawdy, earthy pleasures titillate still in the sketches of Heinrich Zille, the poetic folk satirist and painter who knew them best and once observed that you can kill a man with his lodgings as well as you can with an ax. <br><br>&#x201c;I hated the class system,&#x201d; Leni Riefenstahl confided to a friend. She was turning ninety then, living in a sheltered lakeside villa in Bavaria, distant enough in every way from Wedding to give perspective on her birthplace, a basic tenement flat in the two-block-long Prinz-Eugen-Strasse. The rooms were first lodgings for first-time parents who were almost newlyweds, married in a civil ceremony on April 5, 1902, nearly five months before their daughter saw first light in August. <br><br>Leni&#x2019;s father, Alfred Theodor Paul Riefenstahl, was not yet twenty-four when she was born. He was one of three boys and a girl born to Gustav and Amalie (n�e Lehmann) Riefenstahl in 1878 in the rural Brandenburg district surrounding Berlin. His father had been a blacksmith like his father before him, but Alfred&#x2014;blond and burly and wearing an upturned Kaiser Wilhelm mustache&#x2014;had been drawn to Berlin by economic opportunity. He styled himself &#x201c;salesman&#x201d; on documents, but in fact he was a plumber. He would in time build his own sanitation and ventilation business as domestic plumbing became standard: niceties turned into necessities, and a plumber into an entrepreneur. <br><br>Leni&#x2019;s mother, Bertha Ida Scherlach Riefenstahl, was almost twenty-two when her daughter was born. Bertha was a willowy beauty with dark eyes, curly dark hair, and a determined jawline, all of which she passed on to her only daughter, who was born cross-eyed. Bertha herself was the eighteenth child of a mother who died giving birth to her in Wloclawek (now&nbsp;in Poland) on October 9, 1880. Shortly after Bertha&#x2019;s mother died, her father&#x2014;Leni&#x2019;s carpenter grandfather&#x2014;married his children&#x2019;s nanny and fathered three more children, for a total of twenty-one. <br><br>There is a mystery here, one that might amount only to a niggling biographical puzzle were it not a hint of the shifting images of the past that Leni would manipulate as times changed and perspectives with them. Her background unavoidably aroused curiosity in the 1930s among powerful figures of the Third Reich as she rose to prominence among them. Rumors that she was Jewish&#x2014;or partly so&#x2014;gained currency in this period and traced an alleged line of Jewish descent through Bertha. Once aired, the rumors gained wide circulation in the European and American press during the early years of the Third Reich, though the allegations were never proved and were officially repudiated by the ultimate Third Reich authority, the F�hrer himself. Leni brushed the subject aside then and later as the poisoned residue of a malicious campaign orchestrated against her by Nazi propaganda minister Dr. Joseph Goebbels. <br><br>While some of the rumors were almost certainly inspired by Goebbels or others jealous of her position and privileges in the 1930s, not all of them were. Some of Leni&#x2019;s closest friends and colleagues, including Dr. Arnold Fanck, the film director credited with Leni&#x2019;s discovery, believed that Bertha was Jewish. As Leni&#x2019;s onetime mentor and lover&#x2014;and later a Nazi Party member&#x2014;Fanck&#x2019;s objectivity and veracity are not beyond challenge. Less equivocal is the testimony of art director Isabella Ploberger, who worked and lived with Leni and Bertha during World War II and took for granted that Bertha&#x2014;&#x201c;a lovely person, a fine person&#x201d;&#x2014;was Jewish. Ploberger believed that Goebbels knew, which accounted for his animosity. <br></p><h2>Managing Acquisitions: Creating Value Through Corporate Renewal</h2><p>* How can acquisitions help improve a firm&#39;s competitive position and lead to value creation? * Why do many acquisitions fail to live up to expectations? * Why do many managers think that integration means &#34;make the other firms like us,&#34; rather than build on the complementary elements that were the original justification for the acquisition? * How can a management team improve its success with acquisitions? * How and what can firms learn from their acquisition experience? These persistent questions are addressed in this important book by Philippe Haspeslagh and David Jemison. Though much has been written about hostile takeovers, megamergers, and corporate restructuring, little attention has been paid to strategic acquisitions that firms throughout the world are using to accelerate the renewal of their business. After eight years of research in 20 companies in the United States, Europe, and Japan, Haspeslagh and Jemison offer a welcome antidote to an overly financial view of acquisitions. Real value, they show, is created only after the agreement is signed -- through managerial actions, not financial engineering. Against their innovative theory of how acquisitions create value, the authors examine the reality of acquisition decision making in most firms. Ironically, they point out, less effective acquisition decision making does not stem from a lack of analysis, but from problems in the acquisition process itself. The importance of their message manage the acquisition process -- becomes more vivid when Haspeslagh and Jemison address integration, identifying common problems and challenges. In addition, they offer a powerful framework for managers to think through their integration approach. For each phase in the acquisition process, Haspeslagh and Jemison provide rich descriptions and pragmatic advice based on some of the world&#39;s most experienced strategic acquirers. The unique scope of this book bridges theory and practice to provide the most comprehensive study of acquisitions to date. Managing Acquisitions spans the process from acquisition decision making through integration, combining sound theoretical insight with practical advice. Moreover, it goes beyond acquisitions to address strategic vision and the commitment necessary to make firms capable of learning and change.</p><p><b>Philippe Haspeslagh</b> is Associate Professor of Business Policy at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France, and Director of its Strategic Issues in Mergers and Acquisitions Executive Program. <b>David Jemison</b> is Associate Professor of Management and Joseph Paschal Dreibelbis Faculty Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin. This book is based on the authors' research on acquisitions in ten countries as well as their experience as educators and advisors in the area of acquisition management and corporate development in international firms.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> <b>Mastering the Acquisition Process </b></p><p><b> The Key to Value Creation</b> </p><p> Acquisitions have a unique potential to transform firms and to contribute to corporate renewal. They can help a firm renew its market positions at a speed not achievable through internal development. They can provide an ability to gain all the benefits from combining assets and sharing capabilities in a way not obtainable through partnerships. More profoundly, however, acquisitions can bring into a company capabilities the organization finds hard to develop, or they can provide the opportunity to leverage existing capabilities into much more significant positions. </p><p> The aim of this book is to help unshackle the potential of mergers and acquisitions by providing a perspective that differs from the prevailing financial, or even strategic, views. Our primary message is that key differences between acquisition success and failure lie in understanding and better managing the <i>processes</i> by which acquisition decisions are made and by which they are integrated. </p><p> Our arguments are directed to managers, executives, and directors of firms whose acquisitions are driven by strategic, not simply financial, motives for corporate renewal. They also address the interests of scholars concerned with how strategic factors, organizational factors, and performance interact in acquisitions. </p><p> <b>ACQUISITIVE PHENOMENON</b> </p><p> In the past, acquisitions tended to come in distinct waves, but in the eighties acquisitions became an increasingly broad-based phenomenon as firms renewed their competitive positions, as industry after industry went through its own wave of restructuring, and as acquisition activity spread across the globe. Although it is too early to tell to whether the current level of acquisitive activity will continue or is just another wave, its composition is more varied and its nature more international than those of earlier waves. </p><p> In the United States, acquisition transactions in excess of $35 million increased from $186.4 billion in 1985 to $234.1 billion in 1989. Of these totals, acquisitions by European firms accounted for $28.8 billion, or 12.3 percent, compared with $4.5 billion in 1985, a figure that represented 2.4 percent then. Recently Japanese finns have begun to make acquisitions in the United States, moving from $126.5 million in 1985 to $7 billion in 1989, which is still only 3 percent of all acquisition transactions. Notwithstanding the publicity received by hostile takeovers during the period, the number of hostile bids in the United States was relatively small. During the period 1985-1989 there were only 114 such hostile takeover contests with a purchase price of more than $50 million. Of these, only thirty-eight were ultimately acquired. </p><p> In Europe, acquisition activity has not traditionally been as intense as it has been in the United States. Only Great Britain has an American-style market for corporate control. Yet with $87.1 billion of recorded acquisitions in 1989, European acquisition activity had increased eight-fold since 1985, a figure that might be underestimated, given the less complete reporting of transactions involving privately held firms. In terms of value, cross-border acquisitions had risen from 13 percent in 1985 to 36 percent in 1989, as the move to an integrated Europe gathered steam toward a unified market in 1992. Strong regional differences persisted, born out of different traditions and regulatory contexts. </p><p> In the meantime, Japan, which historically had known acquisitions mainly as an orderly rescue for troubled firms, was warming up to acquisitive development. The number of acquisitions involving Japanese companies increased from 289 in 1985 to 660 in 1989. Of this 1989 total, only fifteen were acquisitions by foreign companies in Japan. </p><p> In sum, going into the nineties, the acquisition phenomenon appeared increasingly broad based, fragmented, and global. Yet the issue of making acquisitions work has been relatively ignored by the academic literature, as well as by the media coverage of large takeovers. Ironically, while the public's attention has been turned to raiders, hostile takeovers, and financial acquisitions, the great preponderance of acquisitions in the United States and the United Kingdom, and almost all the activity in Continental Europe and Japan, has been strategic, generally amicable, and among firms and management groups who have neither sought nor encouraged publicity. Public attention is focused on the wrong issues for understandable reasons. After all, hostile takeovers by rapacious acquirers make far more interesting stories than friendly divisional acquisitions that contribute to the patient renewal of a firm's capabilities and competitive position. </p><p> <b>THE DEBATE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS</b> </p><p> Acquisitions have engendered an important debate among managers, public policy makers, and academics about their effects on, and importance to, economic welfare. Most of the academic research on acquisitions focuses on the financial impact of acquisition transactions, logical prescriptions for screening acquisition candidates, or the effect of acquisitions on the people or communities involved. While these issues are clearly complex, there is common agreement that from the perspective of the acquiring company, many acquisitions fail to accomplish their purpose. But the factors associated with these disappointing acquisition experiences are not addressed. We suggest that a focus on the pre-acquisition decision making and the post-acquisition integration processes will lead to new insights into how acquisitions can be used more effectively for strategic renewal. </p><p> <b>PROBLEMS IN ACQUISITION DECISION MAKING</b> </p><p> The problems frequently presented by pre-acquisition decision making are not self-evident. Whatever the pressures for time and secrecy that surround acquisition decisions, companies and managers do not make such decisions lightly, and they expend substantial resources to make the best decision possible. Yet they readily acknowledge frustrations with the process, as illustrated by this manager, whose acquisition we studied: </p><p> The speed with which things took place was mind-boggling. If we had done that sort of quickie analysis for a capital expenditure decision, the board's audit committee would have been down around our ears in a minute.<br> Chief financial officer of an acquiring firm </p><p> In an environment often characterized by real or perceived pressures for speed and secrecy, many managers and specialists engage not only in a process of analysis and evaluation, but also in a process of internal selling and negotiation, the outcome of which is not only an agreement to bid a certain price, but also a much more complex view of how the acquisition will be justified. As our research has revealed, despite all formal analysis and due process, the quality of that justification is often wanting, as acknowledged by another manager we interviewed: </p><p> A big justification for the merger was to cross-sell to each other's customers. But we made money in such different ways [fee for service versus interest income] that...nobody spoke the same language. Ultimately, we discovered that the fundamental characteristics of our customer bases were quite different and there wasn't nearly as much overlap as we had originally thought or hoped for.<br> Senior executive of an acquiring bank </p><p> <b>THE PROBLEMS OF INTEGRATION</b> </p><p> Decision-making problems are only a part of the story. Even if an acquisition opportunity is sound, the expected synergies have to be realized during the integration phase. Here, too, the contrast in experiences is stark. Consider the following comments from firms that were less experienced in acquisitions: </p><p> The chairman and president brought the top 10 people from both finns together and told us that we had a lot of potential if we could merge product lines and use each other's systems. They then told us that although there would be some start-up costs, they were confident that synergies would more than outweigh these and that we shouldn't have a performance dip. After they left the room, the two sides sat stating at each other, wondering why we were there and how we were going to make it work.<br> Executive from an acquired financial services firm </p><p> We were cast adrift...there was no support for us within the parent firm and nobody understood what we were. This was OK until the managers sent by the parent arrived with no instructions about what to do except make money.<br> Manager in a finance company acquired by a bank </p><p> The lack of direction that comes through in these remarks contrasts sharply with the sense of purpose that stands out in comments by experienced acquirers: </p><p> We knew from day one that they had to retain their entrepreneurial, market-oriented culture and be run at arm's length. Yet at the same time, we had to find ways to get the synergy.<br> Manager in ICI after the Beatrice Chemicals acquisition </p><p> When we make an acquisition, we adopt a centralized approach from the outset. We have a definite plan worked out when we go in, and there is virtually no need for extended discussions.<br> Manager in Electrolux after acquiring Zanussi </p><p> A lot of the success [with the integration] stemmed from the [negotiation of a] policy statement. The statement itself went into the drawer and never came out again. Its importance was that through protracted negotiations over every clause, each side came to understand the primary concerns of the other, and most importantly that trust and commitment was built up.<br> Managing Director, British Petroleum's Nutrition business </p><p> Why do some companies seem to handle acquisition decisions well when others do not? Why are some able to provide direction to integration efforts where others fail? In this book we describe the process by which value is created by firms, explore the ways in which acquisitions can contribute to value creation, and then address solutions to problems that management teams encounter when they use acquisitions as part of their overall corporate renewal strategies. Understanding this process of value creation, however, will require a shift in conception of the firm from a focus on immediate financial outcomes or current product-market positions to the capabilities that underlie these positions or financial results in the long term. </p><p> <b>KEY CHALLENGES IN MANAGING ACQUISITIONS</b> </p><p> Our research has identified four common challenges in managing acquisitions: </p><p> * Ensuring that acquisitions support the firm's overall corporate renewal strategy.<br> * Developing a pre-acquisition decision-making process that will allow consideration of the "fight" acquisitions and that will develop for any particular acquisition a meaningful justification, given limited information and the need for speed and secrecy.<br> * Managing the post-acquisition integration process to create the value hoped for when the acquisition was conceived.<br> * Fostering both acquisition-specific and broader organizational learning from the exposure to the acquisition </p><p> The variety and range of issues involved in strategic acquisitions are quite broad, as illustrated by the following example. </p><p> Strategic Acquisitions: The Case of BASF </p><p> For senior managers in BASF, one of Germany's diversified chemical giants, the spring of 1985 was a fascinating time. The <i>Vorstand,</i> as the management committee of German companies is called, was considering three different acquisition opportunities in the United States. The combined value of these acquisitions was $1.3 billion, which would significantly shift the geographic and business portfolio of the group. </p><p> One involved a bid for Inmont, the U.S. paint manufacturer. The acquisition would bring capabilities to project BASF's Paints division into one of the top three positions in the automotive paints sector, which was becoming increasingly concentrated and global (PPG and Du Pont were the other leading companies). At the same time, however, Inmont's printing ink businesses would present a considerable organizational challenge in an area where BASF was present but had had, until now, limited ambitions. The auction of Inmont involved many of BASF's traditional competitors, including ICI and Akzo. </p><p> Akzo, considered one of the most eager candidate buyers for Inmont, was at the same time the prospective seller in a second acquisition decision BASF was facing: the purchase of American Enka's fiber business. The logic here was quite straightforward: Enka's Fibres business strengthened BASF's vertically integrated position in the U.S.-fibers market and provided captive use for the company's American caprolactam facilities. </p><p> The third acquisition, a bid for Celanese Corporation's advanced composites businesses, was quite different. Whereas current applications of advanced composites were mainly in aerospace and military and civilian aviation, future applications foreseen for this industry were vast. These composites would provide high-performance substitutes for higher-volume automotive components and other applications. Despite its early position, Celanese had decided it could not wait for the payoffs from its investment to come. BASF, like other bidders, had to decide whether it was willing to pay a big premium for the opportunity to make the future investments required to develop the capabilities it would need to remain a key player in this emerging industry. </p><p> These three acquisitions illustrate the interwoven nature of strategic acquisition and divestiture activity among firms, not only in the chemical industry, but in a vast array of fields ranging from power equipment to consumer goods to financial services to publishing to transportation. Above all, they illustrate how the over-publicized deal-making aspect is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the challenges faced by managers who make strategic acquisitions. </p><p> Challenge #1: Consistency with Strategy </p><p> Acquisitions are strategic decisions that can both reinforce and change a firm's direction. But ensuring that acquisition decisions are consistent with strategy is difficult, no matter how clear top management is about its current strategy or how disciplined a strategic planning process a company has. Individual acquisition opportunities call a firm's strategy into question almost as often as they fit with it. When should acquisition opportunities that fall outside the scope of the strategy be discarded, and when should they be embraced as a new potential thrust for the firm? Each of the three BASF acquisitions is an example of this ambiguous relationship between acquisitions and strategy: </p><p> * The Enka acquisition was fairly straightforward as a logical way of implementing the company's well-defined strategy of building a strong vertically integrated position in the United States.<br> * The Inmont acquisition opportunity, on the other hand, did not fit with the recently approved strategy for the Paints Division. The company had already tried to penetrate the U.S. automotive paints market on a much smaller scale through Glasurit America Inc. But in absence of a realistic chance to acquire significant market sh...</p></p><h2>The Primitive Edge of Experience</h2><p>&#34;This is an extraordinary and exciting book, the work of a truly original and creative psychoanalytic theoretician and most astute clinician. Ogden continues to expand and to deepen his reformulations of the British object-relations theorists, M. Klein, W. R. Bion, D. W. Winnicott, W. R. D. Fairbairn, H. Guntrip, to illuminate further the world of internalized object relations. His concepts are evolutionary and at times revolutionary. As his generous case examples aptly demonstrate, Ogden&#39;s theories are solidly grounded in his discerning work with a broad variety of patients. His brilliant pathfinding will enlighten and enrich the reader with invaluable insights. He will listen with new ears and with a fresh conceptual framework with which to comprehend the most primitive elements of human development and the complex interplay among the different modes of experience. This is a bold, important, instructive, and stimulating book of equally great clinical and theoretical applicability.&#34; -The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association</p><p><b>Thomas H.

What began as a search for love ends up as the conquest of personal freedom. </p><p>A marvel of storytelling, <em>Daughter of Fortune</em> confirms once again Isabel Allende's extraordinary gift for fiction and her place as one of the world's leading writers.</p></p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, February 2000:</b> Until Isabel Allende burst onto the scene with her 1985 debut, <i>The House of the Spirits</i>, Latin American fiction was, for the most part, a boys' club comprising such heavy hitters as Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa. But the Chilean Allende shouldered her way in with her magical realist multi-generational tale of the Trueba family, followed it up with four more novels and a spate of nonfiction, and has remained in a place of honor ever since. Her sixth work of fiction, <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>, shares some characteristics with her earlier works: the canvas is wide, the characters are multi-generational and multi-ethnic, and the protagonist is an unconventional woman who overcomes enormous obstacles to make her way in the world. Yet one cannot accuse Allende of telling the same story twice; set in the mid-1800s, this novel follows the fortunes of Eliza Sommers, Chilean by birth but adopted by a British spinster, Rose Sommers, and her bachelor brother, Jeremy, after she is abandoned on their doorstep. <blockquote> "You have English blood, like us," Miss Rose assured Eliza when she was old enough to understand. "Only someone from the British colony would have thought to leave you in a basket on the doorstep of the British Import and Export Company, Limited. I am sure they knew how good-hearted my brother Jeremy is, and felt sure he would take you in. In those days I was longing to have a child, and you fell into my arms, sent by God to be brought up in the solid principles of the Protestant faith and the English language." </blockquote> The family servant, Mama Fresia, has a different point of view, however: "You, English? Don't get any ideas, child. You have Indian hair, like mine." And certainly Eliza's almost mystical ability to recall all the events of her life would seem to stem more from the Indian than the Protestant side. <p> As Eliza grows up, she becomes less tractable, and when she falls in love with Joachin Andieta, a clerk in Jeremy's firm, her adoptive family is horrified. They are even more so when a now-pregnant Eliza follows her lover to California where he has gone to make his fortune in the 1849 gold rush. Along the way Eliza meets Tao Chi'en, a Chinese doctor who saves her life and becomes her closest friend. What starts out as a search for a lost love becomes, over time, the discovery of self; and by the time Eliza finally catches up with the elusive Joachin, she is no longer sure she still wants what she once wished for. Allende peoples her novel with a host of colorful secondary characters. She even takes the narrative as far afield as China, providing an intimate portrait of Tao Chi'en's past before returning to 19th-century San Francisco, where he and Eliza eventually fetch up. Readers with a taste for the epic, the picaresque, and romance that is satisfyingly complex will find them all in <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p><p>An orphan raised in Valparaiso, Chile, by a Victorian spinster and her rigid brother, vivacious young Eliza Sommers follows her lover to California during the Gold Rush of 1849. Entering a rough-and-tumble world of new arrivals driven mad by gold fever, Eliza moves in a society of single men and prostitutes with the help of her good friend and savior, the Chinese doctor Tao Chi'en. California opens the door to a new life of freedom and independence to the young Chilean, and her search for her elusive lover gradually turns into another kind of journey. By the time she finally hears news of him, Eliza must decide who her true love really is.</p></p><h2>We will prove them herewith</h2><p><p>The Savior has given us a plan of salvation which, if followed, will ensure our happiness and lead us back to God. Exactly what does that plan require? How does it function in eternity and in our immediate lives, and how necessary is it? What can we expect if we implement the plan fully in our lives? These are questions we must answer if we wish for the true happiness and eternal success that God has promised His faithful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>In We Will Prove Them Herewith, Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Council of the Twelve of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sensitively discusses these questions. He examines such frequently misunderstood topics as the function of time and God's eternal perspective of life as contrasted with our oftentimes shortsighted perspectives. He dwells on the need for trials, endurance, and obedience to God. He talks of the qualities we need to aid us eternally, especially in this season immediately preceding the second coming of the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>Elder Maxwell writes, "When life is viewed superficially, granted, it can seem routine and pedestrian. However, what appears on the surface can be a thin cover for developments of spiritual significance." This book will help all those who wish to maintain, in the words of Elder Maxwell, "gospel perspective in the midst of ordinariness, the pressures of temptation, tribulation, deprivation, and the cares of the world."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></p><p></p><h2>Fool&#39;s Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error</h2><p><p>"Eureka!"</p><p>In an age of open-mindedness, many believers accept too much with too little discernment, resulting in great confusion and compromise. But God's Word makes it clear that not everything that glitters is gold. False teaching is at every turn, and the temptation to embrace it is great. As God's people we are called to sift through the overwhelming number of traditions and trends and use the truth of Scripture to determine which are the true treasures-and which are "fool's gold."</p><p>General editor John MacArthur and the contributors of this uncompromising book define the principles of biblical discernment and use them to address several contemporary Christian issues. They provide straightforward, biblical critiques of some popular but unfortunate Christian trends, such as watered-down preaching and doctrinally questionable best-selling books. Dr. MacArthur ends with a practical plan for cultivating discernment in the Christian life.</p><p>It is the duty of every Christian-not just pastors and elders-to follow the biblical command to cling to what is good and to reject what is not. This book will equip you with a foundation for biblical discernment that will enable you to make careful distinctions in your thinking about truth.</p></p><p><p><strong>John MacArthur</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, where he has served since 1969.

Visit her at DeborahHalber.com.The Skeleton Crew <br> <br>PROLOGUE<br> <br>THE WELL DRILLER<br> <br>I&#x2019;m looking around a Cracker Barrel in Georgetown, Kentucky, wondering if I&#x2019;ll recognize him. The only photos I&#x2019;ve seen of Wilbur J. Riddle were taken four decades ago, when he stumbled on the corpse wrapped in the carnival tent.<br> <br>He was forty years old then; with his tousled dark hair and strong jaw, he resembled Joaquin Phoenix with sideburns. Even in black-and-white, Riddle looked tanned, a shadow accentuating the taut plane of his cheek. His short-sleeved shirt unbuttoned jauntily at the neck, he stood slightly apart from three pasty, grim, steely men with buzz cuts, dark suits, and narrow ties. They seemed preoccupied, dealing with a body where a body had no right to be.<br> <br>Throwing the photographer a sidelong glance and a faint smirk, Riddle alone seemed cocksure and unfazed. In time, he would end up just as invested as the Scott County sheriff and state police, if not more so. He would become the father of sixteen and grandfather of forty and would still be escorting people out to the shoulder of Route 25&#x2014;X marks the spot&#x2014;where he found her. Somebody might have been tempted to charge admission.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s thought about asking the state of Kentucky to put up a marker along the guardrail: the Tent Girl memorial plaque. She&#x2019;s a local legend. Parents invoke her&#x2014;an unidentified murder victim whose face is carved onto her gravestone&#x2014;as the fear factor that has hurried two generations of children to bed on time.<br> <br>But she&#x2019;s more than that.<br> <br>Tent Girl drew me in. As I delved into the world of the missing and the unidentified, her story would transform the shopworn whodunit into something altogether different&#x2014;the whowuzit, I&#x2019;ll call it&#x2014;in which the identity of the victim, not the culprit, is the conundrum. Her story supplanted the tweedy private eye or world-weary gumshoe of my expectations with a quirky crew of armchair sleuths who frequented the Web&#x2019;s inner sanctums instead of smoke-filled cigar bars. Her story was rags to (relative) riches, triumph of the underdog, and revenge of the nerds all rolled into one. Tent Girl, by becoming separated from her name, also invoked a murky psychological morass of death and identity where&#x2014;judging from my companions&#x2019; faces whenever I brought it up&#x2014;most people would rather not go, but that I felt perversely compelled to explore.<br> <br>There are a dozen versions of the story of Wilbur Riddle stumbling upon Tent Girl. Some newspapers had him trip over the body instead of merely notice it. The victim&#x2019;s age was sixteen or twenty; she was five-one or five-eleven; she had a white towel draped over her shoulder or wrapped around her head or there was no towel at all; Riddle tore open the bag and looked at her before the police arrived or he stopped what he was doing as soon as the odor hit him. The pulp classic Master Detective magazine told Riddle&#x2019;s story, calling him &#x201c;Bart Cranston&#x201d; throughout.<br> <br>I go to Kentucky in 2011, forty-three years after Tent Girl&#x2019;s discovery, and scan the Cracker Barrel customers milling around the sock monkeys and dishtowels and handmade soap. The place smells like lilac and frying bacon.<br> <br>Finally, I spot someone with a receding hairline and doughy cheeks whose mouth, I imagine, reflects that younger man&#x2019;s smirk. The man I have figured for Riddle nods at me; maybe he&#x2019;s been interviewed so many times he can easily pick out the writer in a room full of nostalgic kitsch. He&#x2019;s wearing a crisp blue windbreaker, button-down shirt, khakis cinched tight with a brown leather belt, and running shoes. He&#x2019;s trim, his gait stiff but quick.<br> <br>We&#x2019;re seated at a booth and Riddle orders the country breakfast, scrambled eggs and a biscuit smothered in pasty white gravy. Coffee mugs are refilled and people go about their business apparently unaware of Riddle&#x2019;s fame, even though this particular Cracker Barrel is less than ten miles from where he found her. He peers at me over the plates and scowls when I mention a documentary being made about the case. &#x201c;I wish they&#x2019;d get it over with and let the girl go. They done enough,&#x201d; he says, and I think maybe he&#x2019;s sick and tired of the whole sordid affair. But then he starts to tell me what happened on May 17, 1968.<br> <br>Riddle drilled water wells for a living. He arrived at a work site&#x2014;a new Gulf station near a minuscule town called Sadieville&#x2014;on a pleasantly sunny Friday morning to find a note plastered to the windshield of his Chevy truck. The towering scaffolding of Riddle&#x2019;s drill rig was stowed, its hydraulics, levers, spindles, and winches idle after Riddle drilled &#x201c;way down pretty deep&#x201d; the day before, as he recalls, without hitting much water. The note instructed Riddle to hold off on any more drilling until the boss arrived.<br> <br>The planned gas station was situated at the off-ramp for exit 136 of the brand-new four-lane Interstate 75 running from Kentucky&#x2019;s southern border to its northernmost tip. The interstate would link the county to one of the busiest highways in America, supplanting nearby US 25 as the major thoroughfare heading east to Cincinnati and west to Georgetown, the county seat, with its ornate General Grant&#x2013;style courthouse. US 25, two narrow lanes that still meander past limestone ledges and hug a tributary of Eagle Creek in Sadieville, spans a literal shift, between Kentucky and Ohio, and a figurative shift, from the South to north of the Mason-Dixon Line.<br> <br>Around a month before Riddle showed up for work that day in May, four hundred miles away in Memphis, James Earl Ray had gunned down Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as King stood on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel. In the days and weeks following the assassination, fires and riots erupted in more than a hundred cities, killing forty and injuring thousands. A light-infantry brigade from Fort Benning, Georgia, was called out to Baltimore the day after the shooting to help quell looting mobs. Among the army recruits on high alert at the base was slight, dark-haired nineteen-year-old James William &#x201c;Billy&#x201d; Matthews, whose son would one day compete with Riddle over Tent Girl like knights jousting over a maiden.<br> <br>In Scott County, the bucolic countryside was dotted with sleekly muscled Kentucky Derby contenders munching unnaturally green turf behind fences so white they hurt your eyes. The creatures&#x2019; placidly whisking tails could lull you into believing that most bad news originated very far away.<br> <br>Riddle, Kentucky born and bred, inherited his bad-boy looks and blue-collar profession from his father, who could find water during even the driest stretch of summer, when local streams were nothing more than dusty furrows. Riddle&#x2019;s father taught him the secrets of the divining rod. You held on to a slender, pale switch from a beech tree, and when you went over a vein, the tip&#x2014;the base of a letter Y&#x2014;dipped straight down toward the earth as if something powerful had grabbed hold of the other end.<br> <br>Riddle also learned where to collect jugs of pure clear spring water that bubbled up from the ground year-round. In 1789, one such spring had provided the water for a Baptist minister&#x2019;s new concoction called Kentucky bourbon whiskey. It was this fabled system of underground springs that Riddle intended to tap at the construction site.<br> <br>The note on Riddle&#x2019;s rig bought him some free time. As he drove up that morning, he had spotted linemen working on utility poles around a quarter mile from where the gas station was being built. He left his red Ford pickup&#x2014;his shop truck that rattled with tools&#x2014;parked beside the rig and ambled a few hundred yards toward Route 25.<br> <br>At the intersection with Porter Road, workmen were stringing cable. Even tiny Sadieville, consisting of a train station and not much else, was getting connected to the modern world. Maybe, Riddle thought, he could score some of those old hunks of glass his buddy was so fond of. First made in the 1850s for telegraph lines, by the 1960s glass insulators were outmoded, regularly discarded from utility poles and snapped up by collectors. Roughly the size of a diner sugar dispenser, mushroom-shaped or with protrusions like Mickey Mouse ears, they came in brilliant blues, greens, and reds, and collectors had rude and fanciful names&#x2014;snotties, globbies, comets, boulders, hockers, fizzies&#x2014;for the objects and air bubbles frozen inside the glass.<br> <br>The mercury was edging up, portending a glorious spring day. Riddle wore his standard work uniform, a short-sleeved, greenish-gray collared work shirt, chinos, and a zippered jacket. After collecting his shop truck to cover more ground and searching pole to pole along the creek, he was juggling an armful of insulators when he spotted a bundle tucked partly under a big rock next to a dead redbud tree.<br> <br>Something lumpy was wrapped up in a dark green tarp, the ends secured with rope tied in square knots threaded through round brass eyelets, on the creek side of a sagging waist-high fence around twenty paces from the roadway. The fence, strung with a single strand of barbed wire, skirted the edge of the gravel pull-off where Riddle had left his truck.<br> <br>The hot, muggy spring had spawned weeds and wildflowers that gave off an acrid aroma, and the air was abuzz with all manner of flying and crawling insects&#x2014;woodland ground beetles; gawky, long-legged assassin bugs; iridescent blue cuckoo wasps&#x2014;and a dozen kinds of flies. Something about the shape of the bundle struck Riddle. He approached the dark green bundle, put down the hunks of glass on the rock slab, and looked more closely. It was around four feet long, lumpy, wrinkled, and V-shaped, as wide around as a small tree trunk. Later, some would surmise that the bag had been first set down on the rock and then hoisted over the fence, a snag on the barbed wire leaving a slit in the fabric.<br> <br>Riddle saw something inside. An animal of some kind? He nudged it with his foot, then tugged on a corner of the tarp. It teetered on the edge of the embankment and then rolled around thirty feet into a gully, and he followed it. He stepped on the tent. Something inside felt hard through the sole of his work shoe. Then he noticed a slit, maybe a foot long. A stench wafted through the torn fabric. The odor was overwhelmingly bad, knock-back-your-head bad, like fishing bait left too long in Tupperware.<br> <br>The smell helped Riddle guess the worst; in any case he was in it now, too late to continue on his way back to his truck and prepare his drill rig as though it was just another day on the job. He was alone at the bottom of a steep embankment, trapped on one side by a creek too wide to pick his way across, with only birds and bugs for company. Had he called out, no one would have heard him.<br> <br>As the bundle rolled, the tarp had come away. He took a step closer.<br> <br>Riddle didn&#x2019;t want to admit it, but the odor and the hairless, blotchy, parched veneer he could see inside the tarp didn&#x2019;t leave much room for doubt. It looked, he told me over biscuits and gravy, &#x201c;like a body in there.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a few minutes that must have felt longer, Riddle stood next to the bundle considering his predicament. A thousand flies flitted about. Unseen by Riddle, the squirming larvae of thousands more were at work within the bag at his feet. It was quiet. The utility workers were gone. No cars passed on Route 25. He stood down where she was for a while, thinking what to do. &#x201c;If I was to leave and someone was to come in there and see a body in there, they might have thought I had put it there,&#x201d; he reasoned.<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t a criminal but his past wasn&#x2019;t lily-white. He had seven kids and a third, young wife at home. Riddle was a ladies&#x2019; man and a maverick&#x2014;�defiant, as some put it&#x2014;and there were those who might wish him ill. He had no idea who was dead at his feet. If he raised the alarm, would he change from Wilbur Riddle, onetime bartender, known rogue, and womanizer, into Wilbur Riddle, Scott County good citizen, or Wilbur Riddle, murder suspect? He had to think this thing through.<br> <br>Finally, abandoning the glass insulators on the flat stone, Riddle scrambled up the embankment to the pull-off where he&#x2019;d left his shop truck, climbed behind the wheel, and screeched off for Sadieville&#x2019;s nearest operating filling station, a Chevron. He slid coins into a pay phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bobby, this is Wilbur. Wilbur Riddle,&#x201d; he said when the Scott County sheriff picked up. &#x201c;I think I found a dead body.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cruising in my rented Toyota along Route 25, Riddle and I retrace the path the sheriff, deputy sheriff, and coroner took from the Georgetown courthouse that day.<br> <br>Over in the passenger seat, Riddle seems complacent. He&#x2019;s pushing eighty-five, yet despite his many missing teeth making him sound like he&#x2019;s got a mouthful of marshmallows, his remaining hair is slicked back neatly and his shirt is ironed. The whiff of cologne drifting toward me reminds me of Riddle&#x2019;s reputation as a ladies&#x2019; man. I sense him eyeing me. &#x201c;You from Ohio?&#x201d; he asks after a bit. &#x201c;Boston,&#x201d; I remind him.<br> <br>Riddle points out houses for which he dug the wells, the rock quarry where his cousin was killed in a car wreck, a sign for a place called Stamping Grounds, named for the buffalo that used to roam Kentucky. Riddle clearly likes the spotlight, relishes acting as tour guide. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you a good story, the story of my life,&#x201d; he offers. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d really be something. It&#x2019;d be worth listening to.&#x201d;<br> <br>We pass a church. It&#x2019;s Sunday and Riddle gazes out at the packed parking lot. &#x201c;That church is the kind of church I belong to. Church of Christ,&#x201d; he informs me. &#x201c;I read the Bible every day. I believe in church. I really believe in it. And a Christian life&#x2019;s not a bad life. One of the best lives you can live.&#x201d;<br> <br>I say something noncommittal and keep my eyes on the road. But Riddle isn&#x2019;t ready to drop the subject. &#x201c;What church you belong to?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t go to church,&#x201d; I tell him. Riddle suddenly sits up a bit straighter in his seat. &#x201c;You never been baptized?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I think uneasily about the signs I had spotted on the highway: JESUS IS COMING. ARE YOU READY? and HELL IS REAL. An enormous billboard challenges in three-foot-high letters: IF YOU DIED TODAY, WHERE WOULD YOU SPEND ETERNITY? The nearby Creation Museum, with its display of animatronic dinosaurs playing with children in the Garden of Eden, comes to mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s something I believe in,&#x201d; Riddle continues. &#x201c;What the Bible is trying to say is, you must repent and be baptized to enter into heaven. And I don&#x2019;t know you very well, but I know that you don&#x2019;t want to go to hell.&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s something we can agree on. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go to hell,&#x201d; I say cheerfully, and luckily we have to confer on which direction to turn at the next traffic light.<br> <br>We arrive at the Gulf station, now an empty lot with a faded remnant of the old orange sign, where he had shown up for work that day. A minute later he directs me to pull over near a guardrail that wasn&#x2019;t there in 1968. The shoulder is a weedy patch of grass. The fact that the former clearing was once the first pull-off available to northbound drivers exiting the highway at the Sadieville interchange was not lost on investigators.<br> <br>Riddle climbs out of the Toyota and lumbers through the underbrush. He squints toward the creek.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s April, but it snowed last night. Hints of green poke through white patches on the brown leaves. I follow a few steps behind Riddle, who is zigzagging through the brush. &#x201c;Here it is,&#x201d; he says, pointing to the flat rock where he...</p><h2>A Futile and Stupid Gesture: How Doug Kenney and National Lampoon Changed Comedy Forever</h2><p><b>Now a Netflix original film starring Will Forte, Domhnall Gleeson, and Emmy Rossum.</b><br><br> Comic genius Doug Kenney cofounded <i>National Lampoon</i>, cowrote <i>Animal House</i> and <i>Caddyshack</i>, and changed the face of American comedy before mysteriously falling to his death at the age of 33. This is the first-ever biography of Kenney--the heart and soul of <i>National Lampoon</i>&#x2014;reconstructing the history of that magazine as it redefined American humor, complete with all its brilliant and eccentric characters. Filled with vivid stories from New York, Harvard Yard, Hollywood, and Middle America, this chronicle shares how the magazine spawned a comedy revolution with the radio shows, stage productions, and film projects that launched the careers of John Belushi, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, and Gilda Radner, while inspiring <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and everything else funny that&#x2019;s happened since 1970. Based on more than 130 interviews conducted with key players including Chevy Chase, Harold Ramis, P. J. O&#x2019;Rourke, John Landis, and others and boasting behind-the-scenes stories of how <i>Animal House</i> and <i>Caddyshack</i> were made, this book helps capture the nostalgia, humor, and enduring legacy that Doug Kenney instilled in <i>National Lampoon--</i>America&#x2019;s greatest humor magazine.</p><p><b>Josh Karp</b> is a freelance journalist who writes for a variety of national publications, including <i>The Atlantic Monthly Online</i>, <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, <i>Premiere</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Salon.com</i>.Screenwriter Kenney (<i>Animal House</i>; <i>Caddyshack</i>), co-founder of <i>National Lampoon</i>, was one of the gifted gagsters who ignited the 1970s revolution in American humor. Journalist Karp (<i>Playboy</i>; <i>Premiere</i>) delivers an iridescent, polychromatic portrait of the humorist, framed within an amusing anecdotal history of <i>National Lampoon</i>. To chart the magazine's rise and fall, Karp conducted 150 interviews, mapping every avenue of business decisions, feuds, romances, cocaine use and bizarre pranks. It all began at Harvard, where wild wit Kenney and misanthropic Henry Beard became "symbiotic creative forces," revitalizing the <i>Harvard Lampoon</i>.

The seventeen-year-old, new to evrything around her&#x2015;college, the East Coast, bodies of literature, and the sexual flurries of student life&#x2015;is shocked by her desire to follow this wherever it will take her.

They would get deeper and more heartfelt, she knew, with warm oranges and pomegranate reds, and she could hardly wait for the experience. Like every other sensation, that sight was still before her. But already they were goldenrod and butternut on the ground, and up in the trees (she looked skyward) infinite greens, all the apple and lime and melon flesh she could imagine. They were so beautiful she wanted to eat them or breathe them, take them inside her, make them part of herself. At the very least, she wanted to not ever forget them. She told her memory to hold on to them; there might come a time later when she would need their solace. She came from a place where autumn meant oncoming dampness and fog, the new drawl of the school year: a plain, dull gravity of shoulders and hope. Nothing like this fierceness of light and the brisk bite of cold on the cheek, which seemed playful, a love nip, rather than a somber slap of warning that winter might come. She was not yet wary of the winters here, having not moved through one. She knew this approaching splendor meant death and decay, the boding of ice-prisoned branches and slippery black streets, butcould not make herself feel the grief in it. All this vividness she could read only as exhilaration. Not melancholy. Flannery abandoned herself to movie clich�s of the East she'd learned as a girl in the West. She kicked her tennis-shoed feet through the leaves. She buried her hands in the pockets of her coat, which had a serious weight she was not used to. She knew that this lift of fall glory, which brought her to a shocking peak of happiness--from where, suddenly, she had a complete panoramic view; could see the shape of her future, the blank scope of her forthcoming cities and days--she knew that she would never again reach such a height of pure, sensual pleasure. Never again in her life. She was seventeen. She had no idea about anything, really. And she was about to meet someone--literally, around the next corner. Within that person, a new and altogether unsuspected happiness waited. <i>Copyright</i> � <i>2001 by Sylvia Brownrigg</i></p><h2>The Trial of God</h2><p>Bound in the publisher&#39;s original cloth over boards, spine and cover stamped in gilt.

Not only does Wanda survive she thrives. In flower-power paintings splashed with lemon and lavender, British newcomer Wisdom shows Wanda's busy, guilt-ridden parents buying her everything she wants to make up for the time they spend away from her ("As the years passed, the gifts grew greater. Life-sized dolls, whale-sized wading pools, theater-sized TVs"). One day Wanda throws a tantrum because she can't have a garish kite she fancies. "A truly remarkable kite, but beware,/ It can do horrible things when it's up in the air!" the shopkeeper warns. The kite, with a crafty, sloe-eyed expression and a will to match the heroine's, carries wailing Wanda off into the sky and dumps her on an uninhabited island. After emerging from her dejection, Wanda discovers that she can cook, make tools and even entertain a blue whale, who kindly gives her a ride home once the heroine realizes what is really important: "I don't miss my fancy clothes or TV, or any of my toys. I just really, really miss my mom and dad." Didactic though the tale might be ("Stick with me and you will see/ we don't need to live like kings!/ And I've decided anyway.../ There's more to life than things!" says Wanda at the close), the sly text gives the message plenty of spice, and the sophisticated art will likely please children and adults alike. Ages 4-8. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Ages 5-8. Spoiled Wanda usually gets everything her heart desires, so when she's told that beautiful kite she has her eye on isn't for sale, she rants and stomps about. As usual, she gets what she wants, but not before she's warned that her prize is no ordinary kite. Before she knows what's happening, the kite whisks her away and dumps her on a deserted island, informing her that it's time she learns a few lessons. Learn them she does: she builds a sturdy bamboo hut, makes clothes from banana leaves, and cooks delicious fish. By the time she sails home on the back of her new friend, a blue whale, she has learned the most important lesson of all: "There's more to life than things!" The illustrations are a good match for the story, being much like Wanda herself--loud, brash, colorful, and dynamic. The cartoon-style figures ably capture Wanda's harsh nature as well as her transformation into a happy person. The end of this story is really "The Beginning!" A good vehicle for starting discussions about our materialistic society. <i>Lauren Peterson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This book presents for the first time in a single volume nearly 200 priceless objects from collections all over the world. The best known example is the virtually intact tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun, discovered in 1922, but there are many other colections and individual pieces extant: diadems, armlets, pendants, rings, bracelets, earrings, buckles, breastplates, necklaces, amulets - wrought in Nubian gold, lapis lazuli, brilliant colored faience and blood red carnelian. These opulent jeweled pieces, many modelled after organic forms such as vultures, cobras, falcons, lotus flowers, scarab beetles and winged half-human goddesses, are among the most splendid objects of Egyptian antiquity. Cyril Aldred&#39;s lively text covers the enchanting story of each piece, including misdeeds and discoveries both ancient and modern. He explains the fascinating uses and significance of Egyptian jewels, the materials, and the techniques used to transform these materials into the exquisitely decorative trappings of wealth for kings and queens. Mr. Aldred&#39;s text, which covers the finest pieces from every major find, is illustrated throughout with line drawings in addition to photographs, many in brilliant color, taken under special conditions in the Cairo Museum by Albert Shoucair. As one prominent Egyptologist noted, Jewels of the Pharaohs is unequalled in its comprehensiveness and destined to be a standard for generations.</p><p></p><h2>Spice Up Your Health: How Everyday Kitchen Herbs &amp; Spices Can Lengthen &amp; Strengthen Your Life</h2><p>Spices have long been treasured both for their flavor and for their potential to improve our health.

Feeling as if she was plunging headlong into what Carl Jung termed "the afternoon of life," she wrestled with self-doubt and a searing disquietude that would awaken her in the middle of the night. Set adrift by loss&#x2014;her father's early death; the life-threatening illness of her infant son; her troubled relationship with her mother&#x2014;she had become edgy and uncertain.

Mann and Emily Braun for The Jewish Museum, New York (September 1989-January 1990), an exhibition that explores the extraordinarily rich artistic legacy of Italian Jewry. This book, like the exhibition itself, focuses on four time periods: the Empire, the Era of the City States (1300-1550), the Era of the Ghettos (1550-1750), and the period since the Risorgimento. Artifacts and architecture are generously represented along with fine arts. Essays by prominent scholars introduce us to the historical and cultural context of a splendid array of works, from ancient Roman architectural fragments and gold glass to illuminated manuscripts and printed books from the Renaissance, baroque ceremonial textiles and silver, and paintings, graphics, and sculpture of the modern era.

As much as any, the committee's actions determine the economic well-being of every American. The availability of money for business or consumer loans, mortgages, job creation and overall national economic growth flows from those decisions. Perhaps the last Washington secret is how the Federal Reserve and its enigmatic chairman, Alan Greenspan, operate. In <i>Maestro,</i> Bob Woodward takes you inside the Fed and Greenspan's thinking. We listen to the Fed's internal debates as the American economy is pushed into a historic 10-year expansion while the world economy lurches from financial crisis to financial crisis. Greenspan plays a sometimes subtle, sometimes blunt behind-the-scenes role. He appears in <i>Maestro</i> up close as never before -- alternately nervous and calm, plunging into mathematics one moment and politics the next, skeptical, dispassionate, always struggling -- often alone. </p><p> <i>Maestro</i> traces a fascinating intellectual journey as Greenspan, an old-school anti-inflation hawk of the traditional economy, is among the first to realize the potential in the modern, high-productivity new economy -- the foundation of the current American boom. Woodward's account of the Greenspan years is a remarkable portrait of a man who has become the symbol of American economic preeminence.</p></p><p>Bob Woodward called his biography of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan <i>Maestro</i> for two reasons. First, Greenspan is a musician. He started out as a Julliard-trained jazz sax man. "He wasn't a good improviser," Woodward reports. And while the other guys got stoned all night, Greenspan "read economics and business books and eventually became the band's bookkeeper." He also cultivated powerful pals, like Ayn Rand, whose coterie dubbed the dour young man "The Undertaker."<p> More profoundly, Greenspan is a maestro, a conductor, exquisitely attuned to every instrument in the political and economic orchestra. He rules by consensus, but with a firm hand and notoriously inscrutable words. Marvelously, Woodward relates that Greenspan had to propose twice to his wife, the violinist-turned-TV news star Andrea Mitchell, before she understood: "His verbal obscurity and caution were so ingrained that Mitchell didn't even know that he had asked her to marry him." Woodward gives us the inside story of what Greenspan really thinks and how he outmaneuvered the most ruthless politicians on earth in some of the hairiest times imaginable, from the 1987 stock market crash to the 1994-95 Mexican crisis to the stomach-churning turn of the century. It turns out that for all his awesome knowledge of monetary minutiae, the Fed chief literally relies on "a pain in the pit of my stomach" to make decisions. "At times, he found his body sensed danger before his head," writes Woodward. The Fed chief also adapts Einstein's technique to economics, hunting for discrepancies as keys to deeper theories. Einstein made breakthroughs out of bent light; Greenspan deduced productivity gains that government statisticians had overlooked for years. (The gains appeared when Greenspan made the statisticians calculate productivity by business sector, the way it's done in the real world.) </p><p> Woodward's prose is cool and rational, not exuberant. But if you're into economics and politics, you'll find a rich gossip trove here. Who knew Reagan had a draft of a presidential order to shut down Wall Street trading at hand in 1987? Scary! Reading <i>Maestro</i> is better than sitting with Greenspan in his famous tub as he charts your future--it's like being right there inside his head. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Bob Woodward,</b> an assistant managing editor of <i>The Washington Post,</i> has been a newspaper reporter and editor for 30 years. He has authored or coauthored eight number one national nonfiction bestsellers.</p><h2>A Gesture Life: A Novel</h2><p>Franklin Hata, a Japanese man of Korean birth living in suburban New York, seems on the surface to be living a quiet and harmonious life, but actually he remains tormented by his wartime love for a Korean Comfort Woman. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Never judge a book by its cover--or, for that matter, by its name. Otherwise you might overlook <i>A Gesture Life</i>, Chang-rae Lee's fine if awkwardly entitled follow-up to <i>Native Speaker</i>. As he did in his debut, the author explores the dilemma of being an outsider--and the corrupt, heartbreaking bargains an outsider will make to adapt to his surroundings. The protagonist, Franklin Hata, has actually spent his whole life donning one variety or another of existential camouflage. First, as a native-born Korean, he bends over backwards to fit into Japanese culture, circa 1944. Then he attempts a similar bit of environmental adaptation in postwar America--more specifically, in the slumbering New York suburb of Bedley Run. But in neither case does he quite succeed, which gives the novel its peculiar, faltering sense of tragedy.<p> "There is something exemplary to the sensation of near perfect lightness," confesses this resident alien, "of being in a place and not being there, which seems of course a chronic condition of my life but then, too, its everyday unction, the trouble finding a remedy but not quite a cure, so that the problem naturally proliferates until it has become you through and through. Such is the cast of my belonging, molding to whatever is at hand."</p><p> <i>A Gesture Life</i> presents this chronic condition in two different time frames. In one, delivered via flashback, Hata is a medical officer in Japan's Imperial Army. Posted to a tiny installation in rural Burma, he's ordered to oversee a fresh detachment of Korean "comfort women"--i.e., victims of institutionalized gang rape. At first he maintains his professional distance, not to mention his erotic appetite: "It was the notion of what lay beneath the crumpled cotton of their poor clothes that shook me like an air-raid siren." But soon enough he's drawn into a relationship with one of the women, whose bloody and horrific denouement leaves a permanent mark on the "unblissed detachment" of his existence.</p><p> The present-tense, American half of the story revolves around Hata's life in Bedley Run, where he adopts, alienates, and finally forms a shaky rapport with his daughter, Sunny. We might expect this sort of material to pale in comparison with his wartime trauma. But oddly enough, Hata's suburban melancholia is much more compelling--and the gradual disclosure of his past, which is supposed to ratchet up the tension, seems too crude a mechanism for a writer of Lee's superlative talents. (His truest tutelary spirit, in fact, might be John Cheever, who gets an explicit nod at one point.) None of this is to dismiss <i>A Gesture Life</i>, whose dual narratives are written with a rare, unhurried elegance. And if Lee's splice job lacks the absolute adhesion we expect from a great work of art, he nonetheless pulls off a remarkable, moving feat: he puts us inside the skin of a man who, "if he could choose, might always go silent and unseen." <i>--James Marcus</i></p><b>Chang-rae Lee</b> is the author of <i>Native Speaker</i>, winner of the Hemingway Foundation/PEN/Hemingway Award for first fiction; <i>A Gesture Life</i>; <i>Aloft</i>; <i>The Surren</i>dered, winner of the Dayton Peace Prize and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; and <em>On Such a Full Sea</em>.

Dillard is the author of numerous Star Trek novels, including the movie novelisations GENERATIONS, FIRST CONTACT, INSURRECTION and NEMESIS, and the bestselling non-fiction pictorial history WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> <i>Captain's Starlog, Supplemental. While mapping an area of uncharted space, we have encountered a populated planet -- which is sending out a beacon that our Universal Translator has garbled. Communications Officer Ensign Hoshi Sato is currently trying to decipher what she can.</i> </p><p> Jonathan Archer sat in his command chair on the bridge of <i>Enterprise</i> and stared at the image of the Minshara-class planet on the main viewscreen before him: the larger-than-Earth globe, blue-speckled with large verdant islands rather than continents, rotated lazily. </p><p> Frankly, Archer was grateful for the signal, and suspected the rest of his crew was, as well; the process of mapping lifeless planet after lifeless planet had grown tedious, and he was looking forward to some interspecies interaction. He was hoping that this particular planet, which they would have labeled Kappa Xi II, was transmitting its signal in order to welcome interstellar travelers. </p><p> He was, in fact, hoping for a distraction. Today was a day that came every year -- and every year Archer found a way to remember it, to mark it, and then spent the rest of the day trying to forget so that emotion would not interfere with his efficiency. </p><p> That very morning, shortly after he had risen from his bunk -- even before he had fed his reproachful-looking beagle, Porthos -- he had stepped barefoot over to his tiny closet, removed a picture from the top shelf, and stared at the image for a full minute. It showed Zefram Cochrane, a tall, lean man, all sharp angles, shoulders, and elbows, with a tanned, deeply lined face and a shock of white hair to match his shocking white grin. One of his long, skinny arms was thrown over the shoulders of an equally tall man -- this one younger, with dark hair, but with a grin just as wide. </p><p> "I'm here, Dad," Archer had said. "I'm really here." The words brought with them both a tightening of his throat and a deep sense of satisfaction; they brought, also, disappointment that his father, Henry Archer, had not lived to see the ship he spent his life building launch. </p><p> Today marked the anniversary of Henry Archer's death; and his son Jonathan Archer's life was devoted to fulfilling <i>Enterprise's</i> intended mission -- to explore the unknown. </p><p> Now, hours later, Archer was seated in his command chair on the <i>Enterprise</i> bridge, doing exactly that -- and hoping to establish contact with another new race of aliens. </p><p> But, as he turned to look expectantly at Hoshi (already under the scrutiny of Ensign Travis Mayweather at helm, Lieutenant Malcolm Reed at tactical, and Sub-Commander T'Pol at the science station), his hope grew fainter. As Hoshi listened and relistened to the message, her dark eyes focused on a far-distant point, her lips resolved themselves into a thinner and thinner line, and the crease between her delicate jet brows deepened. </p><p> "Anything?" Archer prompted at last. </p><p> "I need more time to do a thorough translation." Hoshi shook her head, then added, "It's not good." </p><p> "How so?" </p><p> "I'm pretty sure it's a distress call. Some sort of medical emergency. But I can't get any more detailed than that...." She sighed. "From the articulation of the sounds, I'd say the population is humanoid; at least, their lips and tongues and teeth are similar to ours." </p><p> Archer considered this for no more than a matter of seconds, then turned to T'Pol, lithe and spare in her formfitting, no-frills Vulcan uniform, and an equally understated and efficient cap of nape-length ash hair. "What's the atmosphere down there?" </p><p> The Vulcan swiveled gracefully to her station, then looked back at the captain, her expression and tone impassive, despite the news she conveyed. "Breathable. However..." Her gaze became pointed. "I detect very few life-forms." </p><p> It took Archer no more than an instant to make a decision. Regardless of the number of survivors, <i>Enterprise</i> was present, capable of assistance, and therefore obligated to intervene. An entire spe-cies, perhaps, was at risk of annihilation. He pressed the intercom. "Archer to sickbay." </p><p> "Phlox here." </p><p> Keeping his gaze fixed on the worried Hoshi, Archer said, "Doctor, we have an unknown medical emergency down on the planet's surface; the population is probably humanoid. Bring whatever you need to the shuttlepod launch bay. Archer out." </p><p> He stood. "Hoshi, I'll need you to translate what you can. T'Pol, Reed..." He gestured with his chin, and together the four of them headed for the bridge doors. "Mr. Mayweather, you have the conn." </p><p> *�&nbsp;�&nbsp;*�&nbsp;�&nbsp;* </p><p> The flight down to Kappa Xi II's surface was pleasant; Archer was privately cheered by Hoshi's attitude toward it. She had made up her mind to learn to enjoy such expeditions, and peered through the small viewscreen at the looming image of large emerald islands adrift in a vast turquoise sea -- a far different distribution of land to water than on Earth. </p><p> "Gorgeous," Archer murmured, half to himself, as he piloted the shuttlepod closer to one of the larger islands, their destination. </p><p> "Yes," Hoshi echoed, while Phlox made an enthusiastic noise. "Too bad they're having an emergency. This looks like it would be a beautiful place for shore leave...." </p><p> "Quite the tropical paradise," Reed added. </p><p> Archer smiled faintly to himself, remembering the pleasant times he had spent on the island of Kauai. "Just don't expect to be welcomed with garlands of flowers, Lieutenant." </p><p> "It is rather Earthlike," T'Pol commented neutrally from the jump seat, which made the captain consider that a blue-green planet might seem inviting to humans, but perhaps to Vulcan eyes, a red desert planet would be more aesthetically pleasing. </p><p> Still, the ride down through the atmosphere to the coastline of the island was breathtaking; the water closer to the shore was celery-colored and so clear that even from a distance brightly colored creatures could be seen swimming beneath the surface. The sand was pure white, reminding Archer of a Florida beach he'd once visited; at the meeting of water and shore, long-legged birds raced to pluck buried meals from the wet sand before waves rolled in again. <i>Too bad Trip isn't here to see this.</i> Trip Tucker, <i>Enterprise's</i> chief engineer and the captain's best friend, had spent years scuba-diving in the Keys. </p><p> Archer brought the shuttlepod to a smooth landing at its destination, a large paved strip closest to the largest cluster of remaining life-forms. He had wondered whether this large paved area was used strictly for planetbound air travel -- but a glance at his surroundings made it clear that this culture, if not used to extraterrestrial contact, was probably capable of spaceflight. In a nearby hangar, a number of sophisticated vessels rested; Archer eyed them covetously as he brought the shuttlepod to a halt, wishing there were time to inspect them. Instead, he pushed the hatch controls open, and followed his away team out onto the landing strip, adjacent to the coastline. </p><p> Once outside, the first thing Archer noticed was the sun: the sun, shining bright in a cloudless Earth-blue sky, the sun reflecting off the nearby diamond-white sand, off the dappled water, off tall, spiraling buildings that shone like mother of pearl, reflecting pale green, turquoise, and rose. Tall trees, their great blue-green leaves draping down like weeping willows, rustled in a light breeze. </p><p> "An island paradise." Archer sighed. The landing party had dressed in their copper-bronze colored spacesuits on Dr. Phlox's insistence. Had the captain been alone, he would have risked exposure and relied on the decontam procedures on board <i>Enterprise</i> just for the chance to feel the sun and wind against his bare skin. The notion of breathing in a lungful of sea air was enticing. Besides, the suits, with their domed helmets, might make them look rather outlandish to any species unused to regular extraterrestrial contact. But he respected Phlox's opinion, and where his crew members were concerned, he would take all precautions. Reed had insisted on them arming themselves with phase pistols. Medical emergency or not, it was impossible to predict exactly what they might encounter. </p><p> "Beautiful," Reed breathed. </p><p> "Ambient temperature twenty-five degrees Celsius," T'Pol announced clinically, her gaze on </p><p> her scanner. "Life-forms..." She paused, then pointed in the direction of the spiraling buildings. "In that direction, Captain. Very few, and very faint." </p><p> "Let's move," Archer said, all appreciation for his surroundings dismissed. He led the group at a rapid pace, slowing only when Hoshi cried out behind him. </p><p> "Captain!" </p><p> He turned and followed his communication officer's gaze. Peeking out from the profile of one of the silver ships was a hand. Not a human hand -- this one was six-fingered, curled in a limp half fist, the skin a deep greenish bronze. </p><p> Archer arrived at the humanoid's side first, closely followed by Phlox. In the open hatch of the shuttle-sized ship, a male had fallen backward, so that his torso lay faceup on the stone-and-shale landing strip, his legs on the deck of his vessel. Clearly, he'd been stricken as he attempted to leave...fleeing, perhaps, whatever had decimated his people. His complexion was deep bronze, his scalp and ridged brow were entirely hairless; the cartilage of his nose terminated in a sharp, triangular tip, framed by large diagonal slits for nostrils. He stared up at the cloudless sky with almost perfectly round, dark eyes, dulled by death. His expression was entirely neutral, his lipless mouth open to reveal a hard dental ridge mostly covered by pale gums. The hands that fell so limply from his flailed arms were slightly webbed, suggesting that his people had evolved from the sea that covered most of their planet. His clearly muscular body was draped in a soft white, semi-sheer toga with full, winglike arms that made Archer think of the snow angels he'd made as a child. </p><p> Whatever had taken his life, Archer decided, had not inspired fear in him, even if he was running away. He got the impression that the man had sagged gently to the ground, as if he had simply no longer been able to hold himself erect. </p><p> Phlox crouched over the body and scanned it briefly. He glanced up at Archer and said softly, sadly, "Already dead, I fear. Very recently." </p><p> Archer gave a single regretful nod. </p><p> The doctor studied his readouts, then gently touched the dead humanoid, examining the eyes, nose, mouth, and torso. "I'm not detecting anything microbial in his system...." He looked up at Archer, his features furrowed with puzzlement. "In fact, I can't really tell you what he died of. My first guess is that these readings are normal for him...but it would help if I had a healthy member of his race for comparison." </p><p> Reed drew his phase pistol and disappeared into the ship for several seconds, then emerged again, his expression one of awe. "No other bodies, sir. But these people are definitely capable of spaceflight. I know Commander Tucker would love to take one of these apart -- we could learn a thing or two...." </p><p> "Later, Lieutenant," Archer answered shortly. </p><p> "Captain," T'Pol said quietly. Archer took a step toward her and glanced over her shoulder at her scanner. "Chances of finding such a being are becoming slimmer. Since we have left <i>Enterprise,</i> many more life-forms have died. I'm now reading only eleven on this island. The signals are growing increasingly faint." </p><p> "Let's move," Archer said again, gazing down at the dead man, feeling oddly reluctant to leave him without some acknowledgment, some rite to mark his passage. But as the captain turned to face the alien city, he realized the necessity for speed -- else they would be needing a memorial to mark the passage of an entire civilization. </p><p><br> As the quintet strode quickly over a shale-and-sand street toward the building T'Pol indicated, they were met by grisly sights: pedestrians fallen as they walked, in different stages of decomposition under the bright sun. Airborne vehicles carrying single passengers, sometimes pairs, had dropped from the sky, leaving mangled wreckage and toga-draped corpses -- some on the ground, others caught in the swaying trees, or on shrubs, or lying atop a bier of brightly colored flowers. At one point, they passed a body being attended to by a carrion bird; Hoshi briefly closed her eyes, but moved stalwartly onward. Once again, Archer got the impression that the victims had surrendered easily and unexpectedly to death, in the midst of going about their lives. </p><p> He was finally glad for the awkward suit, with its self-contained atmosphere; the smell of decay must have been overwhelming. He thought of Earth's past plagues, and the terror that must have been felt by the survivors. During the Black Plague in medieval Europe, there had been so many dead, the living could not bury them all; a similar thing had happened during the plagues that swept mankind after the third World War. And it had happened to these poor people, in the midst of their beautiful paradise. </p><p> Death came too swiftly sometimes, Archer decided. He was an enormously lucky man; he had lived long enough to be able to do exactly what he wanted to do with his life....<i>Yeah, and Dad lived long enough, but was denied the one dream he had....</i>Archer forced himself to ignore the last thought. At least his father had had the time to create something of real value. But these people -- they were stricken in midstride, without warning. Had they had the chance to achieve their goals? </p><p> He maintained silence, forcing himself to concentrate on the waiting survivors who needed their help; only Hoshi spoke, uttering a single plaintive remark. </p><p> "I only hope there's someone left for me to try to talk to." </p><p> No one replied -- not even Phlox. The streets were still, quiet save for the sound of wind rustling through long leaves, and the cries of seabirds. </p><p> The landing party soon reached their destination: a building with shimmering, nacreous walls that coiled delicately skyward. Large windows overlooked the sea. </p><p> "Like a nautilus shell," Malcolm Reed said as he stared upward, his tone hushed and reverent in honor of the dead. His chiseled, somewhat hawkish features -- so distinctly British, Archer decided -- stood in profile against the cyan sky. </p><p> Yet the building's beauty belied the horror that waited inside. As Archer and his group entered, they were met by an eerie sight. In a large sun-filled room with a view of the sparkling beach, some sixty or seventy bronze-skinned people sat cross-legged on the padded floor -- some fallen forward, faces pressed to the ground, others fallen back against the walls. All wore the same gentle, relaxed expression of the first casualty the away team had encountered. </p><p> Hoshi failed to entirely surpress a gasp; even T'Pol's eyes, behind her visor, flickered for an instant as she steadied herself to do a quick scan. </p><p> "Survivors this way," she said softly, pointing down a gleaming corridor. </p><p> Phlox turned his broad body directly toward the sight, absorbing it fully. "A shame," he said...</p></p><h2>Garfield Swallows His Pride (His 14th Book)</h2><p>Here&#39;s Garfield at his most appealing. Debonair, wise beyond his years--and funny!

Their subsequent adventure, largely told in dialogue, is intertwined with Welsh mythology. This special edition of the award-winning novel, first published in 1965, is introduced by Philip Pullman. Age 9+</p><p>Alan Garner was born and still lives in Cheshire, an area which has had a profound effect on his writing and provided the seed of many ideas worked out in his books. His fourth book, `The Owl Service&#39; brought Alan Garner to everyone&#39;s attention. It won two important literary prizes - The Guardian Award and the Carnegie Medal - and was made into a serial by Granada Television. It has established itself as a classic and Alan Garner as a writer of great distinction.When Alison hears noises in the attic and discovers a set of old dishes decorated with owls, she sets in motion fantastic events that bind her to her new stepbrother, Roger, and bring anguish to her new friend, Gwyn. Wayne Forester&#39;s accents are the perfect vehicle for interpreting this tale rooted in the ancient myths of Wales. The conflicts between the local folk who have lived and worked here for generations and the incoming British owners on holiday are apparent. Forester excels at individualizing the Welsh villagers who comment on the story&#39;s events like a Greek chorus. This enigmatic novel leaves many questions unanswered, but the extensive liner notes provide helpful background, supplying a short summary of the relevant myths and information about the author.

As a field biologist specializing in reptiles and amphibians, Heather Heying has been to some of the most remote places on the globe. Her career consists of trekking through dense rainforests, sitting for hours at a time observing elusive creatures, and spending weeks on end in remote, sometimes inhospitable locales. But nothing she previously experienced quite prepared her for the three seasons she spent studying the tiny, bright, poisonous frogs found only at what is the antipode of her world, both geographically and figuratively - the island-nation of Madagascar.<br><br>The majority of Madagascar's wildlife is endemic -- found nowhere else. Lemurs rule the forest canopy, while on the ground, snakes and lizards search for evening meals of frogs and bugs, all against a gorgeous backdrop of rainforest. It's a biologist's paradise - but at times can also be a foreigner's worst nightmare. Madagascar in no way resembles what most Westerners know as normal existence. Technologically, it is laps behind the first world. Time shuffles by at a slow gait. Poverty is rampant - people pride themselves on how many pots of rice a day they eat. Language and culture barriers, combined with bureaucratic red tape, can make travel virtually impossible.<br><br>In stories that are in turns moving, insightful, hilarious, and beautiful, Heather recounts her experiences -- from run-ins with naked sailors and unusually hostile lemurs to tropical hurricanes and greedy tourist entrepreneurs. As she carefully navigates an obstacle-strewn path, she gradually uncovers the hidden lives of the beautiful yellow and blue poison frogs she studies. And all the while, she is coming to understand her role as a female Westerner in a foreign society, and her intense love for and fascination with the stunning cultures and wildlife of Madagascar. <br></p><p>Heather E.

It is the fourth-largest in the world, after Greenland, New Guinea, and Borneo. All told, it is slightly smaller than Texas. This great red island lies off the east coast of Africa, in the Indian Ocean, not two hundred miles from Mozambique, but has less in common with Africa than one might expect, given its close proximity. Madagascar has been separated from all other landmasses for at least 80 million years, and in that time, the biota has become extraordinary and unique. Ninety percent of its plant and animal species are endemic&#x2014;found nowhere else on the planet. There are neon-spotted frogs, and fully grown chameleons the size of pocket change. Enormous baobab trees looking as if they&#x2019;ve been planted upside down. Bats with built-in suction cups on their wrists and ankles. Carnivorous pitcher plants. Leaf-tailed geckos that flatten against and blend in so perfectly with tree trunks that you can look one in the eye at six inches and think you&#x2019;re admiring bark. Every time you take a step in what remains of the wilderness of Madagascar, new surprises meet your eyes. And then there are the lemurs.More monkey than ape in character, but not actually either, prosimians are among the most primitive primates. All Madagascan prosimians are commonly called lemurs, although some, technically, are not. Living species include the black-and-white indri, which look like giant teddy bears; they sing duets with their mates at first light, and again as the sun sets; their mournful song carries miles across the forest, and often across deforested land where they can no longer live, evoking haunting memories of their bygone presence. The island is also still home to the tiniest of primates, the mouse lemur, a big-eyed fur ball that scurries about in the trees with the aid of its opposable thumbs, the whole package smaller than a human fist. And there&#x2019;s the aye-aye, a scruffy, mangy-looking beast with bat ears and a long, wispy tail. This otherworldly creature uses an elongated middle finger to pull sap and insect larvae out of trees, filling the woodpecker niche in a place with no woodpeckers. Local legend suggests that if you see an aye-aye, you must kill it, else bad luck will fall upon your village. Aye-ayes are, understandably, a bit shy of people nowadays.Aside from the aye-aye, the Malagasy myths that have risen up around the lemurs are mostly ones of exaltation. The indri is believed to have saved a man who, having broken a critical branch, was stranded high up in a tree. It is <i>fady</i> to hurt an indri. Other lemurs are hunted for food, but they are admired for their dexterity and skill in the trees. Tales are told of their social habits&#x2014;one Malagasy friend told me that female lemurs seek out and eat the leaves of a toxic plant when they want abortions. And they are even, sometimes, valued for their beauty in this country at the bottom of the world&#x2019;s economic ladder, where aesthetic concerns are rarely a priority.It is still a matter of some debate how both the landmass of Madagascar and the people living on it came to be there. Madagascar probably split from Africa early in the breakup of Gondwanaland, but remained attached to what would become the Indian subcontinent to the north, Australia and the Southeast Asian islands to the east, and Antarctica to the south and west. The last landmass with which Madagascar rifted was India, which ultimately broke away and moved north toward a collision with Asia that would raise the Himalayas.Were the first Malagasy people Africans, Indians, Southeast Asians (present-day Indonesians), or Pacific Islanders? Perhaps Polynesians, with a bit of Southeast Asian, and some Arab blood, picked up during what must have been a long journey by boat. Few anthropologists agree on when people began arriving on Madagascar. But it is clear that neither the people nor the wildlife bear much resemblance to those on the African continent, and a sure way to insult a Malagasy is to refer to him as African. Although Africa and Madagascar are physically quite close, strong water currents in the Mozambique Channel make it difficult for anything to cross between the two.Madagascar was a stopping point on trade routes throughout the age of colonial Europe&#x2014;indeed, the oldest map of the region where I work was made by Dutch pirates. There are more than twenty distinct tribal groups, several variations on a theme of animist religion, and very little industrial or technological development. The French colonized Madagascar in the late nineteenth century, but they were ousted in a democratic vote in 1958. Lingering French influence explains both the prevalence of the French language across the country and the surreal appearance of fresh baguettes in even rural markets every morning. Due to widespread corruption, the new government gradually began provoking protests, and in 1975, it was replaced by the socialists. From then until 1992, during the socialist era in Madagascar, outsiders were particularly distrusted, and foreigners who hadn&#x2019;t managed to stay behind when the French left were not often let in during this period. The socialists had come in with grand ideals and plans, but they soon fell into disrepute. In 1992, after years of increasingly vocal protests from the people, a multiparty democracy was formed, and Dr. Albert Zafy was elected president. His administration, too, soon lost popularity, and in 1997, in a democratic vote, Didier Ratziraka, the former socialist head of state, became the president of Madagascar. By early 2002, Madagascar was again in a state of uproar, and the future of the Malagasy government was unclear.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Were I telling stories about modern American suburbanites, it might be safe to assume that the time not chronicled is spent watching television, talking on the telephone, shopping, and commuting between home and work. At night, our neighbors retreat to their walleci-off homes, turn on the lights, and make themselves comfortable among their things.In Madagascar, except in the capital, Antananarivo, there are essentially no televisions or phones in anyone&#x2019;s private home. Even in Tana&#x2014;the more manageable name for Antananarivo&#x2014;these luxuries are rare. When present, phones seldom work. In northeastern Madagascar, where I work, people commute, but it is not a commute most Americans would recognize. The locals walk daily between their palm-roofed homes and the outdoor market&#x2014;the <i>zoma</i>&#x2014;which reliably has baskets and rice for sale. Communal pit toilets and open charcoal fires are the bathrooms and kitchens, respectively. Electricity exists only sporadically in the one sizable town in the region. Twice a week, a turboprop lands on the local runway, there being no reliable roads that connect this part of the island to the rest, and all children and some adults within a certain radius come to watch the spectacular event. There are no print media, no books available. A single radio station exists, though few private homes&#x2014;which are primarily open-air shacks&#x2014;have radios. There is no privacy, and few precious things.In Madagascar, time is so abundant as to be unmeasured, such that a request for a boat or a meal or a person to show up at a particular time, even on a particular day, makes no sense. If something else comes up, maybe that gets priority. Maybe not. Who can predict these things, and why would anyone want to? If it doesn&#x2019;t come today, maybe it will come tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow. <i>Peut-�tre demain. Ongomba rapitso.</i> In English, French, or Malagasy, it is perhaps the most often-used phrase in Madagascar. Meanwhile, in the United States, services are advertised based on their ability to get things <i>there,</i> wherever <i>there</i> may be, more quickly than anyone else. &#x201c;When it absolutely, positively, has to be there overnight,&#x201d; you would do well to be in the developed world. In the States, time is measured constantly: Time is slipping away; time is of the essence; time is money. In Madagascar, no amount of coercion can cause things to move more quickly.At the sites where I actually live and work for the majority of the time, there is no commerce, nothing to buy but an occasional fish from a fisherman pulled up onshore. A boat ride away is Maroantsetra, a town of flat, hazy tropical scenes, coconut palms on plains of sandy grasses, a town where you can sometimes buy vegetables, but where there are no appliances, no good shoes, no sunglasses for sale. This town is a flight away from Tana, where for a price you can obtain hydrochloric acid (as advertised in the local newspaper), a television, a Land Rover (only on the black market), an <i>International Herald Tribune</i> from a week ago, a good Indonesian or French meal, and even potted plants.Tana is itself a long series of flights away from machine-washed and dried clothes, new hiking boots, delis, flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce, the <i>New York Times,</i> <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i> Magazine, Thorlo socks, alkaline batteries, duct tape, Krazy Glue, contact lenses, a blood transfusion, skiing, Snickers bars, maple trees and rhododendrons, box springs and mattresses, sulfa-free antibiotics, or anything new and improved. My most remote field site is five miles by foot from a village, which is a few hours by boat from a town, which is several hours by plane from Tana, which itself is several flights away from box springs, or transfusions. At this most remote site, all you can get is emergent trees thrust from the canopy, robed in flowers; lemurs clucking, peering; a parade of both colorful and cryptic frogs; cool breezes, with a stunning view from a tent platform; a vast forest rich with unknown life; and clean, clean air.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The great Pacific was just a mile from our house when I was a child, and when I needed to be reminded of my own insignificance, I would head down to the beach to stare across the vast ocean. In the spring, my father would drive us out of Los Angeles and into the desert, where my brother and I ran through endless fields of erupting wildflowers. The golden-orange California poppies, so garish and delicate, were my favorite. Other than those few weeks each year when sporadic rain caused flowers to actually grow wild, little grew without tending in L.A. The daughter of an Iowa farm boy turned computer engineer, I grew up believing that things don&#x2019;t grow unless people make them do so. My mother made our garden grow, carefully doling out water and nutrients, and if she stopped, everything died. Behind, under, and between her plants, animals from the hills scurried, reveling in this unexpected bounty. My fierce, loyal cat brought me alligator lizards. She would bite off their tails on my bed, where she would leave the tail, twitching, for me to find. It was a clue that somewhere in my bedroom a lizard with a bloody stump was hiding, terrified. This was our game, hers and mine.Every fall, scorching Santa Ana winds would come in from the east, pummeling our already-parched city. If the winds coincided with a spark in the hills, brush fires erupted, sweeping across chaparral and houses with similar abandon. I remember one fire coming over the mountains toward our house, four, maybe five blocks away. A little girl, I stood on the roof with my father, with all the neighborhood fathers on their roofs, hoses in hand, wetting down the tinder of our lives. The fire, which we could not yet see, kissed our faces with raw heat. Finally, my father ordered me down, back to the room where my mother had put my little brother and our two cats. We were ready to escape to a car packed with family photos as soon as my father yelled &#x201c;Go.&#x201d;I fell asleep curled on a pile of blankets. The next morning, I woke confused, sweating, my sinuses filled with ash. The winds had turned, and the danger was past. My parents were haunted by our closest call yet, while the children and animals clamored for breakfast.Days later, I walked through those hills while the ground was still hot, chasing lizards and snakes left uncharred. Gone were the scrubby desert plants, the only natives left in L.A. Most gardens remained, though, filled with foreign plants like agapantha and bougainvillea and night-blooming jasmine, and with yet more exotic plants, from places I could only imagine&#x2014;from Brazil, and from Madagascar.The walls of books that lined our house helped me conjure these faraway places. Many of my favorite memories from childhood are of being curled up alone with a book, hiding from social obligations. I read voraciously, developing early on a passion for fantasy and science fiction and, later, classic literature. A well-told story was the best escape, and until I could start generating my own adventurous narratives, I immersed myself wholly in those created by others.Captivated by great literature all of my life, I was frustrated, in college, to find the opinions of literary theorists dictating which stories were valid and which were not. I left literature for science then, enticed by the promise of distinguishing between plausible and implausible stories by using the scientific method. Initiating my turn toward biology was Bret Weinstein, a friend since high school who, in the summer of 1989, handed me a book by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, suggesting that I might find some meaning therein. I found <i>The Selfish Gene</i> first daunting, then provocative, and finally inspiring.Bret has now been my best friend and lover for many years, and his enthusiasm for evolutionary biology contributed to my own desire to be a field biologist. In 1991, before either of us ever saw Madagascar, we backpacked together through Central America, where we discovered firsthand the wonder of tropical ecosystems, the sheer pleasure of finding animals in the wild, and the privilege of being allowed to watch them do what they do. It&#x2019;s nothing like being at the zoo and finding the monkeys in their enclosures. When you&#x2019;re out in their world, in a vibrant, breathing forest, their real lives are arrayed in front of you in all their complexity. Filled with hunger, predators, and tree falls, those lives can change and grow as you watch.In a way, literature and science are as different as they could be, one seeming to celebrate all the possible alternatives, the other trying to pinpoint which is most likely to be true. But in another way, literature and science are similar, as both aim to construct good stories from real life. Scientific inquiry takes the process a little further&#x2014;it takes the possible narratives and assesses if they make sense, puts them to rigorous tests. Students of literature know that blood is thicker than water. Science offers us the opportunity to understand precisely why this is so. In science, we rely on hypothesis generation and falsification to assess the validity of our stories. But still, stories are what we&#x2019;re generating, and the most interesting stories will always have intrigue and drama, and discovering a story previously untold will forever be exciting.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;During the middle of my first long field season on Nosy Mangabe, a remote island three miles off the east coast of Madagascar, my mother wrote me a letter. In it, she described a conversation she&#x2019;d had with an old family friend. After she had explained to him, as best she could, what I was doing in Madagascar, he was still left with the nagging, and most basic, question: Why do it? She knew that I was, in her words, &#x201c;studying something about evolution in poison frogs ... but why?&#x201d;</p><h2>Historical Archeology: A Comprehensive Guide for Both Amateurs and Professionals to the Techniques and Methods of Excavating Historical Sites</h2><p>Noel Hume, director of the Department of Archaeology at Colonial Williamsburg, provides instructions for the amateur or student archaeologist, covering every phase of digging a site.</p><p></p><h2>The Quotable Tozer: A Topical Compilation of the Wisdom and Insight of A.W.

In brilliant detail Walter Lord traces the human drama of the great attack: the spies behind it; the Japanese pilots; the crews on the stricken warships; the men at the airfields and the bases; the Japanese pilot who captured an island single-handedly when he could not get back to his carrier; the generals, the sailors, the housewives, and the children who responded to the attack with anger, numbness, and magnificent courage.<br><br>In piecing together the saga of Pearl Harbor, Lord traveled over fourteen thousand miles and spoke or corresponded with over five hundred individuals who were there. He obtained exclusive interviews with members of the Japanese attacking force and spent hundreds of hours with the Americans who received the blow -- not just the admirals and generals, but enlisted men and families as well. He visited each of the Hawaiian bases attacked and pored over maps, charts, letters, diaries, official files, newspapers, and some twenty-five thousand pages of testimony, discovering a wealth of information that had never before been revealed. Day of Infamy is an inspiring human document and the best account we have of one of the epic events in American history.<br><br></p><p>There may not be a better book on what happened at Pearl Harbor than <i>Day of Infamy</i>--and it's not as if the Pearl Harbor story has lacked chroniclers. Walter Lord is best known for <i>A Night to Remember</i>, his book on the voyage of the <i>Titanic</i>. <i>Day of Infamy</i> deserves to stand beside that classic as a gripping narrative, and the subject matter, of course, is infinitely more important. <p> Lord begins by showing how Japanese admirals, three months before their notorious sneak attack, "tested the idea on the game board at the Naval War College." (It didn't go nearly as well there as it did in real life.) Then he proceeds briskly through the preparations for the assault and delivers a minute-by-minute account about those fateful hours in Oahu. The detail is incredible. The Japanese scan Hawaiian radio stations to see if their moves have been detected; a U.S. naval officer on "his first night on his first patrol on his first command" spots a Japanese submarine just hours before the strike; when the surprise attack finally does arrive, an excited Japanese commander shouts "Tora! Tora! Tora!" ("Victory!") before even the first bombs have fallen. The whole assault lasted about two hours. Thousands of Americans were killed or wounded. The Navy lost the <i>U.S.S. Arizona</i>, which blew up about 15 minutes into the raid, and 17 other ships were either sunk or crippled. Hundreds of planes were destroyed or damaged. The Japanese, by contrast, lost only 29 planes. It must be considered one of the most lopsided battles in all history--and "battle" probably isn't the best word to describe it. Pearl Harbor was closer to a massacre. Whatever the label, Pearl Harbor was a turning-point moment in American history, and it gave rise, the very next day, to some of the most famous words ever spoken by an American president: "Yesterday, December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States was suddenly and deliberately attacked...." If you intend to read only a single book on Pearl Harbor, this is the one for you. <i>--John J.

Anthony</h2><p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony were two heroic women who vastly bettered the lives of a majority of American citizens. For more than fifty years they led the public battle to secure for women the most basic civil rights and helped establish a movement that would revolutionize American society. Yet despite the importance of their work and they impact they made on our history, a century and a half later, they have been almost forgotten.<br><br>Stanton and Anthony were close friends, partners, and allies, but judging from their backgrounds they would seem an unlikely pair. Stanton was born into the prominent Livingston clan in New York, grew up wealthy, educated, and sociable, married and had a large family of her own. Anthony, raised in a devout Quaker environment, worked to support herself her whole life, elected to remain single, and devoted herself to progressive causes, initially Temperance, then Abolition. They were nearly total opposites in their personalities and attributes, yet complemented each other's strengths perfectly. Stanton was a gifted writer and radical thinker, full of fervor and radical ideas but pinned down by her reponsibilities as wife and mother, while Anthony, a tireless and single-minded tactician, was eager for action, undaunted by the terrible difficulties she faced. As Stanton put it, "I forged the thunderbolts, she fired them."<br><br> The relationship between these two extraordinary women and its effect on the development of the suffrage movement are richly depicted by Ward and Burns, and in the accompanying essays by Ellen Carol Dubois, Ann D. Gordon, and Martha Saxton. We also see Stanton and Anthony's interactions with major figures of the time, from Frederick Douglass and John Brown to Lucretia Mott and Victoria Woodhull. Enhanced by a wonderful array of black-and-white and color illustrations, <b>Not For Ourselves Alone</b> is a vivid and inspiring portrait of two of the most fascinating, and important, characters in American history.</p><p>In 1902, at the age of 83, Susan B. Anthony wrote a letter to her dearest friend, Elizabeth Cady Stanton: <p> </p><blockquote>We little dreamed when we began this contest, optimistic with the hope and buoyancy of youth, that half a century later we would be compelled to leave the finish of the battle to another generation of women. But our hearts are filled with joy to know that they enter upon this task equipped with a college education, with business experience, with the fully admitted right to speak in public--all of which were denied to women fifty years ago. They have practically but one point to gain--the suffrage; we had all.</blockquote><p> Anthony and Stanton had worked together for over half a century for women's rights and were instrumental in keeping the movement alive despite repeated defeats. Sadly, Anthony is best remembered as "the woman on that funny dollar" and Stanton has been largely forgotten. PBS favorites Ken Burns and Geoffrey C. Ward have joined forces again to change all that, in their respectful dual biography of the great suffragettes, <i>Not for Ourselves Alone</i>. The authors trace Anthony and Stanton's very different lives--Anthony was a Quaker who remained single all her life; Stanton was born to a wealthy family and later married and raised several children--from girlhood on through their hard work, frequent disagreements on policy, and unflagging devotion to the cause of women's rights. In this era when fewer than half the eligible voters go to the polls, many have forgotten the struggles of Anthony and Stanton, the sacrifices they made, and the hardships they endured. Anthony, for one, was frequently vilified in the press, cruelly caricatured, and shouted down at lectures. What shines most brightly throughout the volume, however, is the love and respect these women felt for one another.</p><p> With contributions by noted historians Ann D. Gordon and Ellen Carol Dubois, and dozens of evocative contemporary photographs, <i>Not for Ourselves Alone</i> provides a view of the suffrage movement through the eyes of the women who fought hardest for it. "We are sowing winter wheat," Stanton confided to her diary, "which the coming spring will see sprout and which other hands than ours will reap and enjoy." Indeed, neither Stanton nor Anthony lived to be able to cast a ballot. But Burns and Ward have assured them of a larger place in the American memory--as is their right. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Geoffrey C.

In this substantially revised, updated and expanded compendium of two earlier volumes, David Starkey charts its roller-coaster history, starting with the warring tribal kings who continued to exercise their sway under the Romans. New material on the late Middle Ages and the Wars of the Roses brings the story to the turbulent reign of the Tudors and on through the chaos of the Civil War that first unseated and then beheaded a king.</p> <p>The Republic that followed Charles I&#x2019;s execution smashed the Imperial Crown and attempted to eradicate the word &#x2018;king&#x2019; from the language. For a time, it seemed the throne itself had died with its most recent occupant. And yet, vulnerable though it had been shown to be, the monarchy also proved surprisingly resilient, rebuilding itself alongside Britain&#x2019;s burgeoning Empire.</p> <p>Starkey brings the tempestuous story up to the present, guiding us through the abdication of Edward VIII and the dissolution of the marriage between Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, with a new chapter on the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton, royal weddings and the future of monarchy.</p> <p>Throughout, Starkey highlights both the strength and the terrible fragility of an institution that has seemed, at times, perilously close to extinction. Bringing to life a cast of colourful characters, this brilliant overview of the history of Britain through her kings and queens provides an in-depth examination of the monarchy, as well as a vidid and iconoclastic portrait of British culture, politics and nationhood, embodied in an institution that has defined the realm for nearly two thousand years.</p></p><p><p>From one of our finest historians comes an outstanding exploration of the British monarchy from the retreat of the Romans up until the modern day.</p><p>The monarchy is one of Britain&#x2019;s most venerable and revered institutions &#x2013; but also one of its most volatile.

He lives in Traverse City, Michigan.</p>Pleasant essays--five of which won first-prize awards from the Outdoor Writers Association of America--on a youth spent fishing and canoeing the lakes and rivers of northern Michigan, by Dennis (It's Raining Frogs and Fishes, 1992--not reviewed). Having grown up in the 1960's in the vicinity of Michigan's Silver and Long lakes and Au Sable and Boardman rivers, Dennis is able to write of waters once teeming with fish but now barren--and, happily, of once-barren waters now full of fish. He seems to have done a lot of his fishing at night, claiming that nocturnal angling offers ``your best hope of deceiving a large brown trout with an artificial fly.'' In one piece, he and his teenage buddies jump a fence in the dark of night to fish a string of farm ponds in the middle of a pasture filled with grazing buffalo. In others, like ``A New-Moon Bass'' and ``Night Paddling,'' Dennis recalls fishing with his father and floating ``through the darkness on muggy summer nights.'' In 1970, he tells us, he observed hundreds of lake trout circling hypnotically in the glow of dock lights. Though a pilgrimage to the Fox River (Hemingway's model for ``Big Two- Hearted River'') disappoints him, Dennis is pleased to meet Robert Traver, the late author of Anatomy of a Murder. Traver, a former state supreme court justice, delights Dennis by taking him into the back woods to his favorite fishing hole. Dennis also hunts for a legendary huge ``old brown'' living in a dark, still pool of the Boardman. He never catches the fish, but, as he notes, ``catching a trout like that isn't the point. The point, of course, is believing that he's there.'' Smooth, with a gently impressionistic touch--like easy- listening radio for anglers.

Reprint. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>From the Nobel Prize-winning author of Love in the Time of Cholera, a startling new novel -- the story of a doomed love affair between an unruly copper-haired girl and the bookish priest sent to oversee her exorcism.<br><br>Of Love and Other Demons is set in a South American seaport in the colonial era, a time of viceroys and bishops, enlightened men and Inquisitors, saints and lepers and pirates. Sierva Maria, only child of a decaying noble family, has been raised in the slaves' courtyard of her father's cobwebbed mansion while her mother succumbs to fermented honey and cacao on a faraway plantation. On her twelfth birthday the girl is bitten by a rabid dog, and even as the wound is healing she is made to endure therapies indistinguishable from tortures. Believed, finally, to be possessed, she is brought to a convent for observation. And into her cell stumbles Father Cayetano Delaura, the Bishop's protege, who has already dreamed about a girl with hair trailing after her like a bridal train; who is already moved by this kicking, spitting, emaciated creature strapped to a stone bed. As he tends to her with holy water and sacramental oils, Delaura feels "something immense and irreparable" happening to him. It is love, "the most terrible demon of all." And it is not long before Sierra Maria joins him in his fevered misery.<br><br>Unsettling and indelible, Of Love and Other Demons haunts us with its evocation of an exotic world while it treats, majestically the most universal experiences known to woman and man.<br><br>Natasha Richardson's film credits include Nell, Widow's Peak, The Comfort of Strangers, and The Handmaid's Tale. She has appeared on stage in Anna Christie, High Society, Hamlet, and A Midsummer Night's Dream, among others.The oldest of twelve children, Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez was born on March 6, 1928, in the small, banana-growing town of Aracataca, Colombia. Like Fermina and Florentino, the protagonists of his novel <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, his mother went to high school and studied piano, and his father, too poor to complete his medical studies, became a telegrapher. He grew up in the great, gloomy house of his maternal grandparents, raised on his grandmother's tales of spirits and dead ancestors, and the civil war stories of his grandfather, a retired colonel.<br><br>With a new baby born every year, there was no money for school tuition, and at thirteen Garc�a M�rquez applied for and received a scholarship to a boarding school outside Bogot�. His teachers recognized a natural storyteller, a gift Garc�a M�rquez believes some people are born with. "Some people have a sense of timing, of organization of facts," he told the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i> in 1990. "After that, it is a long way to becoming a writer. You have to learn to write well. It is a technical process, a process of elaboration and a capacity to elaborate experiences." Though he would have preferred to study philosophy and letters, Garc�a M�rquez studied law at the National University in Bogot�, because the degree was more practical and the schedule permitted him an afternoon job. He nonetheless made his way through the great works of literature. Influenced by Marxist professors and the desperate economic straits of many Latin Americans, Garc�a M�rquez became a radical socialist.<br><br>By the time the university closed down in 1948 because of political unrest, Garc�a M�rquez had sold several stories to the local newspaper, <i>El Espectador</i>. He left for Cartagena on the Caribbean coast, where he knew he could find work on a newspaper. In 1954 he returned to Bogot� to work again for<i> El Espectador,</i> establishing himself as a well-known journalist. The next year Garc�a M�rquez's first book, <i>Leaf Storm</i>, was published after a seven-year search for a publisher. When his account of the true story behind the shipwreck of a Colombian naval destroyer displeased Rojas Pinilla, the Colombian dictator, the newspaper prudently sent him abroad. Writing short stories all the while, Garc�a M�rquez worked as a freelance journalist in Paris, London, and Caracas, and in 1959 opened the Bogot� office of the <i>Prensa Latina,</i> the newly-created official press agency of Castro's Cuba. In 1958 he married his childhood sweetheart, Mercedes Barcha. His first child, Rodrigo, was born in 1959 and his second, Gonsalvo, in 1962.<br><br>Q&gt;A move to Mexico City was followed by four years in which Garc�a M�rquez wrote no fiction at all. Then, one day in January 1965, as he was driving to Acapulco, the complete first chapter of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> suddenly came to him. He devoted eight to ten hours a day for eighteen months to his writing, emerging with a family saga that mirrors the history of Colombia. Published in 1967, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> became an international bestseller and is considered by many to be his masterpiece.<br><br>In 1982 Garc�a M�rquez won the Nobel Prize for literature. His other works include four collections of short stories (<i>No One Writes to the Colonel</i>, <i>Leaf Storm</i>, <i>Innocent Er�ndira</i>, and <i>Strange Pilgrims</i>), the novella <i>Chronicle of a Death Foretold</i>, and the novels <i>The Autumn of the Patriarch</i>, <i>In Evil Hour</i>, Love in the Time of Cholera, and <i>The General in His Labyrinth</i>.<br><br>Garc�a M�rquez lives on the southern edge of Mexico City, and spends time in Bogot�, Cartagena, Barcelona, Cuernavaca, and Paris. He tries to write a page a day, declaring it "terribly hard work, more so all the time. Every letter I write weighs me down, you can't imagine how much" (<i>Seven Voices</i>). Garc�a M�rquez credits the computer for rescuing him from his perfectionist tendencies; he once went through an entire ream of paper typing the final, letter-perfect manuscript of a fifteen-page short story.<br><br>His leftist beliefs and close friendship with Fidel Castro have not endeared Garc�a M�rquez to the U.S. State Department, which allows him to visit the United States only by special dispensation. He remains a devoted advocate of human freedom and is insistent that Europe and the United States should allow Latin America to develop its own identity - and make its own mistakes - at its own pace and without intervention. "Why is the originality so readily granted us in literature so mistrustfully denied us in our difficult attempts at social change?" he demands.<br><br>Q&gt;Always looking for the story, Garc�a M�rquez still writes occasional pieces of nonfiction. "When I write journalism, some people think I am writing literature. And I am very rigorous when I write journalism, very careful of reality," he told the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i>. "But I have a way of selecting and seeing reality that is very literary.... I see things others don't." His interest lies in describing and storytelling rather than in making moral judgments or grand statements. "The writer is not here to make declarations," he once told his friend Mario Vargas Llosa, "but to tell about things."</p><h2>Duck for President</h2><p>When Duck gets tired of working for Farmer Brown, his political ambition eventually leads to his being elected President.</p><p></p><h2>The Legacy of Mark Rothko</h2><p>Recounts the achievements and bizarre death of this pioneer of abstract expressionism and discusses the landmark lawsuit that exposed the greed and corruption among art merchandisers that contributed to his destruction</p><p>At the time of Mark Rothko&#39;s suicide in 1970, the deeply troubled, pioneering artist of Abstract Expressionism was at the height of fame and financial success; yet within months of the funeral, his three trusted friends, acting as executors, relinquished his entire legacy of 800 paintings to the powerful, international Marlborough Galleries (run by Frank Lloyd) for a fraction of their real worth on terms suspiciously unfavorable to the estate. The suit that Rothko&#39;s daughter brought against the executors and Marlborough rocked the art world with its shocking revelations of corruption in the international art trade: from the deceptions practiced on Rothko when he was alive to the scandals after his death involving conspiracies and cover-ups, double dealings and betrayals, missing paintings and manipulated markets, phony sales and laundered profits, forgery and fraud.<b>Lee Seldes, </b>a former writer for <i>Newsweek, Barron's, The Village Voice, </i>and <i>Esquire,</i> and the only journalist to cover the entire Rothko trial, has substantially updated her definitive account to examine: the recent lives of key participants, including Frank Lloyd's criminal conviction; the ways in which the highly publicized trial over Andy Warhol's estate echoed the Rothko verdict; and the fate of the paintings for which Rothko lived&#x2014;and died.</p><h2>Process Dynamics and Control</h2><p>Printed in Asia - Carries Same Contents as of US edition - Opt Expedited Shipping for 3 to 4 day delivery -</p><p></p><h2>Chicken Soup for the Chiropractic Soul</h2><p>A guide for those who want to know more.</p><p></p><h2>Pharmacy For the Soul: A Comprehensive Collection of Meditations, Relaxation and Awareness Exercises, and Other Practices for Physical and Emotional Well-Being</h2><p><p><b>From one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest spiritual teachers comes a volume of natural therapies in <i>Pharmacy for the Soul: A Comprehensive Collection of Meditations, Relaxation and Awareness Exercises, and Other Practices for Physical and Emotional Well-Being</i>.</b></p><p>This book suggests holistic remedies for a variety of ailments.

At other schools, athletes are catered to and coddled at every turn. At West Point, they carry the same arduous load as their fellow cadets, shouldering an Ivy League&#x2013;caliber education and year-round military training. After graduation they are not going to the NFL but to danger zones halfway around the world. These young men are not just football players, they are soldiers first.</p><p><i>New York Times</i> sportswriter Joe Drape takes us inside the world of Army football, as the Black Knights and their third-year coach, Rich Ellerson, seek to turn around a program that had recently fallen on hard times, with the goal to beat Navy and "sing last" at the Army-Navy game in December. The 2011 season would prove a true test of the players' mettle and perseverance.</p><p>Drawing on his extensive and unfettered access to the players and the coaching staff, Drape introduces us to this special group of young men and their achievements on and off the field. Anchoring the narrative and the team are five key players: quarterback Trent Steelman, the most gifted athlete; linebacker Steve Erzinger, who once questioned his place at West Point but has become a true leader; Andrew Rodriguez, the son of a general and the top scholar-athlete; Max Jenkins, the backup quarterback and the second-in-command of the Corps of Cadets; and Larry Dixon, a talented first-year running back. Together with Coach Ellerson, his staff, and West Point's officers and instructors, they and their teammates embrace the demands made on them and learn crucial lessons that will resonate throughout their lives&#x2015;and ours.</p></p><p><p><b>A Conversation between Jim Dent and Joe Drape about <em>Soldiers First</em></b></p> <p>Joe Drape, the author of the best-selling book <em>Our Boys</em>, is an award-winning sports reporter for <em>The New York Times</em> and the author of <em>Soldiers First: Duty, Honor, Country, and Football at West Point</em>, just published by Times Books. Jim Dent is the author of several best-selling books, including <em>The Junction Boys</em> and <em>Courage Beyond the Game</em>. His new project is <em>The Kids Got It Right</em>, about the integration of high school football in Texas.</p> <p><strong>Dent:</strong> You have a remarkable gift for seizing a story and then living it. This was especially true with <em>Our Boys</em>. Now you have brought the Army football program into focus by jumping on the train and writing <em>Soldiers First</em>. How much fun did you have traveling to West Point and spending that much time with the team? </p> <p><strong>Drape:</strong> You know better than most that when there is no fun it is just work. I really didn't have much knowledge on the history, football or otherwise, of West Point and to even know what the story was I felt like I had to walk the grounds, be in the locker rooms and classrooms and on the military training grounds and get to know these guys. It's the discovery part that is the most important part. We're never too old to learn, and the more you know the better the story.</p> <p><strong>Dent:</strong> You also included your son, Jack, in the story. Has he read it and how much fun did he have?</p> <p><strong>Drape:</strong> Without Jack, there's no book. He gave me the idea one night while we were watching the Notre Dame-Army game. I'm an Irish fan from the Parseghian or Resurrection era of your book. I had an uncle who taught there and my oldest brother graduated from Notre Dame. We made a football game every year. But as soon as Jack saw the pregame show about Army with the marching and parachuting he was sold. His favorite toys were those little green Army men and he said, "Let's go see the good guys, Dad." You and I are Southern Methodist University graduates and we've both seen what the best football team money could buy looks like. College football has been scandal-ridden for a long time. I went looking for the good guys, too. Jack and I had a ball, and we will for a long time now as season ticket holders.</p> <p><strong>Dent:</strong> Long ago, it was said that only baseball could provide the vehicle to intriguing sports stories. I think you will now agree with me that football is the king of great sports books. How did you develop your feel for the sport? </p> <p><strong>Drape:</strong> I'd argue football is really our national pastime because it's truly a team game. It can be brutal and you must rely on the guy next to you to do his job or it can be bone-crunching if he doesn't. It revolves around trust and camaraderie and usually there's a coach who uses charisma and fear to make you execute his vision. You wrote about Bear Bryant in <em>The Junction Boys</em>. I've written now about Coach Roger Barta in Smith Center and Rich Ellerson at Army and their philosophies and methods are all different, but all three of them taught life lessons and tried to develop character in their players. At heart, they are great educators and they have to be. I still don't fully understand the triple option-&#x2013;it might as well be calculus. But I do understand human nature and I'm fascinated about how you get 120 guys juggling an Ivy League workload with state-of-the-art military training to prepare for literally a life-or-death career, to come together on a football field and compete well and with pure joy.</p> <p><strong>Dent:</strong> We both began our writing careers in the newspaper business. There are a lot of "ink-stained wretches" out there, like Michael Connell, making it big in the book business. I believe that deadline writing sharpened my skills. I just bet you feel the same way.</p> <p><strong>Drape:</strong> You've made it big, too. Hell, I still am in the newspaper business and I absolutely love it. I like the variety of subjects and the immediate gratification you get of breaking a big story or writing one pretty well. It&#x2019;s like a golf swing-&#x2013;the more you practice, the better you are. You learn to trust your instincts and you know immediately what is poetry and what's cliche. We both have sat in stadiums with a 100,000 people roaring and we have twenty minutes to write a thousand words that capture the magic we have all just witnessed--to tell an epic tale in miniature. I think you'll agree with this: I can look back at deadline stories done in minutes and know that some of them were the best writing I will ever do. I led with my heart, found a zone, and didn't over think it. It's good training for books or any other storytelling.</p><p><b>Joe Drape</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Our Boys: A Perfect Season on the Plains with the Smith Center Redmen</i>, <i>The Race for the Triple Crown</i>, and <i>Black Maestro</i>.

They were rewarded with popular success, large profits, and even critical adulation. E.J. Clery&#39;s acclaimed study tells the strange but true story of women&#39;s gothic. She identifies contemporary fascination with the operation of the passions and the example of the great tragic actress Sarah Siddons as enabling factors, and then examines in depth the careers of two pioneers of the genre, Clara Reeve and Sophie Lee, its reigning queen, Ann Radcliffe, and the daring experimentalists Joanna Baillie and Charlotte Dacre. The account culminates with Mary Shelley, whose Frankenstein (1818) has attained mythical status.

Dubois</h2><p>Stanley Crouch teams up with noted journalist Playthell Benjamin for this thought-provoking look back at <i>The Souls of Black Folk,</i> the epochal, prophetic work by the great African-American intellectual W. E. B. DuBois. Crouch -- and internationally recognized jazz critic, syndicated columnist, and author -- and Behnjamin appraise the contributions of DuBois's work, noting its uncanny relevance to today's society and its profound impact on the field of African-American studies. <i>Reconsidering the Souls of Black Folk</i> is a fitting tribute to a literary and sociological triumph.</p><p><b>Stanley Crouch</b> is a columnist, novelist, essayist, and television commentator. He has served since 1987 as an artistic consultant at Lincoln Center and is a co-founder of the department known as Jazz at Lincoln Center. He is the author of <i>Notes of a Hanging Judge</i> and <i>The Artificial White Man</i>, among other titles. He lives in New York City. Never less than penetrating and controversial, <b>Playthell Benjamin</b> is a veteran columnist and critic whose work has appeared on many websites as well as in publications such as <i>The World &amp; I</i> and the <i>Village Voice</i>.Pioneering black sociologist and public intellectual W.E.B. DuBois set the terms of debate about race in 20th-century America in The Souls of Black Folk. In this vigorous dialogue, two contemporary black intellectuals assess DuBois's ideas and legacy for the centenary of his most famous work: his evocation of the "double consciousness" of African-Americans in a racist society; his advocacy of the black "talented tenth"; and his challenge to Booker T. Washington's nonconfrontational program of downplaying black civil and political rights in favor of economic advancement. In his two long and generally appreciative essays, historian and journalist Benjamin fills in the educational and intellectual milieu that influenced DuBois (especially the Romantic German nationalism he absorbed during a stint in Berlin), celebrates his nuanced, pathbreaking explorations of black culture and psychology, and defends him against charges of elitism by present-day writers. The much shorter responses by playwright and critic Crouch (Notes of a Hanging Judge) are more critical: he castigates DuBois for his embrace of black separatism, Marxism and Pan-Africanism. (That the latter two "sins" take place entirely outside of Souls doesn't seem to bother Crouch.) Crouch spins DuBois as a betrayer of the Enlightenment principles of equality and democracy that he thinks should be the philosophical foundations of blacks' struggle for freedom. The authors' vigorously opinionated styles (Benjamin attacks Cornel West for his "pretentious mumbo-jumbo" and Adolph Reed for being a "pugnacious misanthrope," while Crouch launches blistering tirades against "greasy crackers" and Communists alike) can be wearying, and the result is that this dispatch, while often provocative, just as often has little to do with the seminal book that gives Crouch and Benjamin their title.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Memories of Midnight</h2><p>A beautiful American widow flees to a remote convent in Greece after an attempt on her life and becomes involved with a ruthless tycoon</p><p>In THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, they played the ultimate game of love, lust, and death.<p>Now, in MEMORIES OF MIDNIGHT, the survivors meet to play one last time...</p><p>Shadowed by tragedy and burdened by amnesia, a beautiful woman desperately tries to return to reality.

Murray, who has been a bettor and an owner, a winner and a loser, at tracks all over America, explores the racing game with the understanding of a savvy insider and the slightly rueful wit of a man who knows it's impossible to find either satisfaction or riches there. But, as one character says, "There's always fresh."

But only sometimes.</p><p>An amiable, anecdotal memoir of a professional writer's perdurable, albeit oft-unrequited, love affair with thoroughbred horses. New Yorker regular Murray, author of the Shifty Anderson racetrack-mystery series (I'm Getting Killed Right Here, 1991, etc.) and other books, recalls how, as a preppy teenager, he contracted an unshakable case of horse fever once he was introduced to the pleasures of the track by a cousin's sporty husband. Having pursued his long-shot avocation while making a solid career for himself as a journalist and author, Murray (a well-born fugitive from Park Avenue) now offers a witty, often rueful account of life as an improver of the breed. A sometime owner, as well as inveterate bettor who appreciates the thrills of victory and agonies of defeat, he provides perceptive assessments of what makes individual punters, jockeys, trainers, handicappers, grooms, and a host of other racing denizens run. Nor does Murray scant the magnificent--if frequently frustrating and heartbreakingly fragile- -beasts on which the track's two-legged animals focus at world- class as well as also-ran courses on the county-fair circuit throughout the US. Covered in addition is the widely ignored reality that gambling underpins the industry that calls itself the sport of kings. An idiosyncratic tour of domestic racing likely to appeal to horseplayers as well as their civilian counterparts. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>New Yorker writer Murray, who also writes racetrack mysteries ( Tip on a Dead Crab ), here looks at offbeat aspects of the sport: competitions at county fairs, where the horses are generally of a fairly low caliber; the races at Agua Caliente in Tijuana, Mexico, where honesty on the part of owners, trainers and jockeys is far from a sine qua non ; and the problems of holding a winnng ticket, which include "breakage" and taxes (the IRS has representatives at the tracks to collect 20% of the big payoffs). Murray, himself a bettor and horse owner, provides such expected coverage as an encomium to jockey Bill Shoemaker, who rode in 40,351 races during his 40-year career. He also, unfortunately, feels constrained to add trite vignettes about the "characters" at the track, mostly seedy, unlettered types who spend their lives barely breaking even, in chapters that dig in ground long since brilliantly excavated by Damon Runyon. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Route 66 Backroads: Your Guide to Scenic Side Trips &amp; Adventures from the Mother Road</h2><p><p>Known as the Main Street of America and the Mother Road, U.S. Route 66 is the nation&#x2019;s best known highway.

Always a difficult vocation, changes in society and the church in recent years have made the ordained life all the more complex and challenging. Is the pastor primarily a preacher, a professional caregiver, an administrator? Given the call of all Christians to be ministers to the world, what is the distinctive ministry of the ordained? When does one's ministry take on the character of prophet, and when does it become that of priest? What are the special ethical obligations and disciplines of the ordained? In this book, Willimon explores these and other central questions about the vocation of ordained ministry. </p> <p>He begins with a discussion of who pastors are, asking about the theological underpinnings of ordained ministry, and then moves on to what pastors do, looking at the distinctive roles the pastor must fulfill. The book also draws on great teachers of the Christian tradition to demonstrate that, while much about Christian ministry has changed, its core concerns--preaching the word, the care of souls, the sacramental life of congregations--remains the same. </p> <p>Ordained ministry is a vocation to which we are called, not a profession that we choose. To answer that call is to open oneself to heartache and sometimes hardship; yet, given the one who calls, it is to make oneself available to deep and profound joy as well.</p></p><p>A comprehensive guide to the joys and challenges of pastoral ministry by one of today&#39;s foremost preachers. &#34;For anyone who is working out &#39;with fear and trembling&#39; what it means to be in ministry, this book is a gift. Will Willimon&#39;s book is solid theology with a profound understanding of Scripture for this ministerial calling.&#34; --Tony Campolo, Eastern College &#34;Pastors are a battered breed these days. Images and impressions range from cheap to glittering to dogged. Will Willimon will have none of it; he counters with an enormous infusion of dignity, but it is dignity without a trace of pomposity. By articulating our baptismal, biblical, and theological foundations, he trumps a demeaning culture and a trivializing church, and restores honor to our vocations.&#34; --Eugene H. Peterson, Professor Emeritus of Spiritual Theology, Regent College. &#34;There is great confusion these days about the role and function of a Protestant pastor. Writing out of his deep knowledge of Scripture and church history, and out of his long experience in the pastorate, Willimon furnishes some clear and compelling answers. I would recommend that every pastor and seminarian read, study, and reflect on this book.&#34; Elizabeth Achtemeier, Union Theological Seminary in Virginia &#34;Pastor is the crowning achievement of Willimon&#39;s years of experience and research. It covers everything, from one&#39;s calling to ministry to every facet of personal and pastoral work with thoroughness and evangelical passion. Anyone who follows this theologically grounded, deeply practical guide will experience a rebirth of their calling and evolution of their ministry.&#34; Robert Webber, Northern SeminaryFeeling most at home behind a pulpit, Will Willimon&#x2019;s deepest calling is to be a preacher and truth-teller of Jesus Christ.

Now Sam Ita, the genius of paper engineering and art, transforms Mary Shelley&#x2019;s tragic masterpiece into an unforgettable, stunning, and accessible pop-up book.</p><p>For the third time, Ita who created the magnificent <i>Moby Dick </i>and <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i> pop-ups successfully captures the rich, dark drama of his source through amazing images. The entire story unfolds almost cinematically, in a potent mix of graphic novel panels and spectacular three-dimensional designs. The gothic building where Dr. Frankenstein carries out his sinister experiment rises high on the page; a scaffold, complete with a rope noose, emerges threateningly; and the misunderstood, rageful monster looms large and menacing, ready to destroy all in his path.</p><p>This is pure visual magic, and a wonderful way to experience a classic.</p></p><p>Sam Ita studied graphic design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY. He apprenticed for five years with Robert Sabuda and Matthew Rhinehart on, among other things, Christmas cards for the Museum of Modern Art. His creations for Sterling include 20,000 Leagues: A Pop-Up Book (9781402757761) Van Gogh&#39;s Sunflowers In-a-Box (9781402758126) and Moby Dick: A Pop-Up Book.Gr 4-8&#x2013;Spectacular special effects more than compensate for a plot chopped to barely recognizable hash in this pop-up/graphic-novel hybrid. With occasional obvious exceptions ("I was just uh...grilling something"), the snatches of dialogue and commentary in Ita's small background panels are drawn from the original and provide notes more ponderous than atmospheric: "often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation...." Gosh-Wow moments start on the first spread, however, where a pull of the tab produces a bolt of lightning and the instant transformation of a rocky outcrop below the castle into a properly hideous giant. In subsequent marvels, the initial triumph on Victor Frankenstein's face moves in stages to disgust on a shaped flap composed of no fewer than four linked layers; the monster rears up with the golden locket taken from the child he's just smothered; jumbled body parts of the second monster are torched in an acetate coffin; and the Arctic finale occurs around an entire team of string-linked sled dogs.

A fine copy in a near fine dust jacket. There is a vertical crease along the right edge of the jacket&#39;s inside front flap.</p><p>Napoleon's colorful but disastrous Russian campaign has been strangely neglected by American publishers. Bridging the gap between popular and scholarly history, historian Cate has written a thoroughly detailed and researched account that should also appeal to the lay reader. His writing is deliberately paced but dramatic and does far more justice to the extremely complex political and military situation of 1812 than Philippe de Segur's Napoleon's Russian Campaign (1965), the only other work available in the United States. This is a good selection for those who identify the Napoleonic era only with Waterloo. Recommended to public and academic libraries. Raymond L.

The two ex-cops think they know D.C.'s dangers, but nothing in their experience has prepared them for Worldwide Wilson, the pimp whose territory they're intruding upon.<br><br>Combining inimitable neighborhood flavor, action scenes that rank among the best in fiction, and a clear-eyed view of morality in a world with few rules, "Hell to Pay" is another Pelecanos masterpiece for his ever-expanding audience to savor.</p><p>In <i>Hell to Pay</i>, Washington, D.C., is just one more thug in an endless list of thugs who brutalize the poor, the weak, and the young. The primary victim this time is a rising star on Derek Strange's Pee Wee football team. In this city where making T-shirts for bereaved families of young murder victims is a full-time business, the boy is an accidental victim in a war between drug dealers and lowlifes.<p> Private investigator Strange, in his second George Pelecanos outing (after 2001's <i>Right as Rain</i>), has seen enough of this face of D.C. His relationship to his secretary/lover Janine sputters in the wake of increasing, irrational infidelities. His moral compass swings wildly as he tracks the killers, Garfield "Death" Potter and friends. Not knowing if he can be satisfied seeing these men in prison, Strange contemplates other brands of "justice."</p><p> For fans of Pelecanos, all the usual trappings are here: the hyper-real dialogue, the bloody street fights, the immersion in classic R&amp;B, and the <i>most</i> current music on the streets. Pelecanos does stumble in a few places. His narrative becomes wooden at times, and his plot features a couple of glaring coincidences (e.g., Strange just <i>happens</i> to jot down the license plate of a car that later turns out to be the one driven by the murderers). But Pelecanos is the real deal in <i>noir</i>. If Dennis Lehane owns Boston and Michael Connelly is master of L.A., Pelecanos is dark D.C.'s intimate chronicler. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>George Pelecanos is the author of several highly praised and bestselling novels, including <i>The Cut</i>, <i>What It Was</i>, <i>The Way Home</i>, <i>The Turnaround</i>, and <i>The Night Gardener</i>.

For nearly two centuries, groups of these lethal criminals haunted the roads of India, slaughtering travellers whom they met along the way with such efficiency that over the years tens of thousands of men, women and children simply vanished without trace. Mike Dash, one of our best popular historians, has devoted years to combing archives in both India and Britain to discover how the Thugs lived and worked. Painstakingly researched and grippingly written. Thug tells, for the first time the full story of the Thugs&#39; rise and fall from its beginnings in the late seventeenth century to its eventual demise at the hands of British officer William Sleeman, in 1840.</p><p>Mike Dash is a Cambridge educated historian.

Schatz' pictures are not about dance; they are photographs of dancers as phenomenal objects: graceful and powerful; explosive or ecstatic in motion, elegant and elemental while at rest. There is more to dance than bodies, but without bodies there is no dance. And however much natural beauty a dancer may have, years of training and a daily regimen that might break an Olympic rower, produce human forms that are nothing less than masterpieces of kinetic sculpture.<br>In Passion &amp; Lies, Schatz interprets these hard-won creations through his art, combining exploration and adoration in equal measure.</p><p>This is not a souvenir book with pretty pictures of swans in tutus and princes in tights; rather, it is a virtual gallery of kinetic sculpture. Members of our leading dance companies, including the San Francisco Ballet, American Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Paul Taylor Dance Company, and others worked with the photographer to capture the very essence of the art of dance. Schatz, whose previous titles range from Water Dance (Graphis, 1995) to Homeless: Portraits of Americans in Hard Times (Chronicle, 1993), explains that the "images in this book are not dance photographs; they are photographs of dancers who performed for an exact moment?for the camera alone.... We collaborated to create the `performances' that resulted in the photographs." An exquisite collection of stunning images well suited for photography, dance, and performing arts collections.?Carolyn M.

Over a period of almost 1,200 years, the ancient Persians learned to cultivate crops such as wheat and barley and to domesticate animals. They also demonstrated their talents for architecture and art by building enormous palaces, such as at the site of Persepolis, and introduced the idea of worshipping a single god.</p><p>This volume of the Discover Ancient Civilizations series explores the lands, people, and cultural heritage of Persia, the civilization that once occupied modern-day Iran. The empire of Cyrus the Great is discussed through the end of the Achaemenid Dynasty and the invasion of Alexander the Great. The historical narrative follows the enlargement of the Hellenic League, wars with Rome, and the eventual rise of Islam. Bramwell emphasizes Cyrus&#x2019; tolerance and respect for the different languages and religions of his vast empire, which at its largest was the size of the continental U.S. The illustrations place a heavy emphasis on the material culture of the Persian Empire, with copious full-color photographs of artifacts and heritage sites.

As an Indian commissioner, he became a student of the Paiute and Ute tribes, an interest that led in 1879 to the birth of the Smithsonian's Bureau of Ethnology, where he was director for 23 years. That same year he would be instrumental in the founding of the US Geological Survey, an agency which he would head just two years later.&nbsp;At 47 he was perhaps the most powerful and influential scientist in America.&nbsp;His ideas for harnessing water in the West inspired the birth of the Bureau of Reclamation and, in 1888, he joined 32 scientists and prominent Washingtonians to establish the&nbsp;National Geographic Society. After his death in 1902 at the age of 68, he continued to influence government science: He donated his brain to research.

Most people don't like change, and few people are really "wide awake" to accept revolution. Most of us&#x2015;including myself&#x2015;are not always truly awake, and rarely do we welcome change even when pretending that we do. We want our comfort, we prefer consistency, and we honor tradition while yearning for the simpler times of the "Good Olde Days."</p> <p>Real revolutions are evolutionary, and, when involved with esoteric and spiritual concepts, their essential function is to wake us up, expand our consciousness, and open doors we didn't see that were there all the time. The difference between revolution and evolution is that one happens to you and the other requires you to take the "next step" to accomplish the change in your reality. Evolution builds upon the past, but the change in your reality is transformative, and even the past looks different from your new perspective and place of understanding. The Tarot is key to this revolutionary evolution.</p> <p>In this book, Jean-Louis de Biasi tells us that the Tarot was created to invoke specific invisible forces that generate energies present both within us and at universal levels. Each card represents a state of consciousness and a particular energy that can be invoked and used in ritual and divination as keys to the most ancient archetypes. Jean-Louis writes: "The Tarot induces an action on the subtle planes that is capable of affecting our invisible bodies, and then reverberating into the physical level in our daily lives." He further writes that the "Tarot was conceived to transmit a secret initiatic inheritance by channeling specific invisible powers and stimulating energies present inside of you that are extant in the entire universe," and that the Tarot's "construction is based on an occult structure that makes each Arcanum a genuine talisman, which is able, merely by its presence, to generate those effects to which it corresponds." However, Jean-Louis does warn the reader that most versions of the Tarot are not completely effective in connecting us with these full powers, and he explains why and reveals the answer to the problem.</p> <p>What you already see is that this divine Tarot is a long way from "the devil's picture book" or the simple art form of the Italian Renaissance. We don't have the "fortune-telling" decks that were so entertaining in Victorian times and we have much more than even promised by the modern magical orders.</p> <p>The Tarot is a system, not a "thing," and as such the Tarot stands alone and independent to fulfill its purpose of providing an inner experience of contacting the divine powers and incorporating them into your own psyche, fostering your psychic development and empowerment. You will then be able to use these powers in solving personal life problems by taking action on the invisible planes.</p> <p>By understanding the secret origins of Tarot symbolism, the reader becomes directly involved with the nearly alchemical process of transformation that is itself the secret of initiation.</p> <p>The sacred language of the Theurgic Tradition was not Hebrew, but Greek. Hebrew was and is prominent not only in Qabalistic studies and magical practices, but it is with the Theurgic Tradition that we find the authentic theoretical and practical uses of the Tarot keys as well as their original correspondences. The Theurgic Tradition is continued to this day in the Ogdoadic Tradition of the Aurum Solis.</p> <p>It is within that ancient tradition, reaching back to the origins of the Tarot, that we correct the errors found in the Waite-Colman deck and other modern decks, that we find the original correspondences of the sacred Greek letters, see the original Qabalistic correspondences to the sacred Hebrew letters, perceive the archetypal relationships with the Greek divinities, and rediscover the sacred names corresponding to these divine powers.</p> <p>Building upon these revolutionary/evolutionary foundations, this book takes the reader well beyond the limitations of ordinary Tarot practices of divination and even of talismanic and ritual magic.</p> <p>Through these uses and active meditation, we are in astral and mental contact with the invisible living spirit, or Angel of the Tarot, that has existed now for thousands of years. It is with the system of the Tarot, and interaction with this angel, that the divine Tarot becomes a complete initiatory experience. We are not limited to just the physical reality; the Tarot enables a true link and a reciprocal exchange between the physical and the non-physical, between our mind and the spiritual world. Through our subtle bodies, the Tarot system makes it possible to enter directly into a relationship with different levels of reality. Thought forms are created of astral substance and then function to connect us with other entities and energies that empower our further evolutionary growth and development.</p> <p>Seeing the Tarot as a genuine symbolic summary of the divine powers at work throughout the cosmos, we enter into new relations and responsibilities as conscious co-creators, knowing that every thought and action has consequences beyond our personal sphere. Even our divination becomes more than interpretation, opening an interactive channel to influence the outcome of the reading.</p> <p>We can go further and use the Tarot cards as astral doorways to travel out-of-body, experience new realities, and to become more than we are!</p> <p>Carl Llewellyn Weschcke<br> 7th Past Grandmaster Aurum Solis</p></p><h2>Headhunters</h2><p><i>The author of "Brennan's War" and "Hunter-Killer Squadron" begins his superb series about the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry with the stories of&nbsp; twenty-eight&nbsp;veterans as told in their own words.</i></p><p><b>HEADHUNTERS </b>holds the personal memoirs of twenty-eight Blue infantrymen, Scout pilots and gunners, and Gunship pilots and gunners of the 1/9th Cavalry Squadron in Vietnam.

Another joined a self-help group, desperately seeking equilibrium. Another walks along the San Francisco Bay on her lunch hours, thinking of Laci Peterson. Others are in counseling and on antidepressants. <p>All seven who collaborated on "We, the Jury: Deciding the Scott Peterson Case" say they never will be the same because of the harrowing trial. But none regrets sending the Modesto man to death row. </p><p>"I know he did it. I don't think he did it," Julie Zanartu said She doesn't eat ribs anymore, having been traumatized by gruesome courtroom photos of Laci Peterson's badly decomposed remains at the bay shoreline. </p><p>"I sometimes wake up crying," juror Richelle Nice, dubbed "Strawberry Shortcake" by reporters covering the case, said in the book. "What is wrong, I think? What went wrong in my life? What happened to me? That is why I am on so much medication." </p><p>"We, the Jury," describes the panelists' disgust when hundreds of people, crowded outside the Redwood City courthouse, cheered as the guilty verdict was announced. </p><p>"I really thought that was sick," Dennis Lear said in the book. </p><p>Juror John Guinasso said: "I made a startling assessment. Maybe they were cheering the process, and not because it was Scott Peterson, but simply because justice was done." </p><p>The book's intriguing points include: </p><p>The jurors initially were impressed by defense attorney Mark Geragos' confident swagger and ease at public speaking, and underwhelmed by Stanislaus County prosecutors' plodding, boring delivery. </p><p>"Stanislaus County was farm country," a passage reads, "and these were farm lawyers ... no match for the express train from Los Angeles." </p><p>Though prosecutors insist they never panicked, they had good reason to early in the trial, the jurors said. </p><p>They pinpointed Frey's secretly taped phone conversations with her lover, Scott Peterson, as a turning point. </p><p>Jurors found the tapes even more valuable in death-sentence deliberations because they confirmed Peterson's callous, deceitful nature -- in his own voice. </p><p>"These tapes exposed him as a man who planned events to accomplish a devious and heinous goal," Guinasso said. </p><p>Jurors remembered Geragos' hollow promise in his opening statement to prove his client "stone cold innocent" as they deliberated Peterson's guilt five months later. </p><p>"He was innocent in all our eyes until the evidence proved him to be stone cold guilty," Nice said. </p><p>Birgit Fladager, now Stanislaus County district attorney, essentially saved the day with her "pizzazz," connection with jurors and "woman's touch." Her father called her "sort of like a steel fist in a velvet glove." </p><p>Swertlow and Stambler weave the jurors' stories of their crucial deliberations into a tale of arrogance, duty and frustration. Most compelling are accounts leading to the early exits of three jurors who were replaced by more reasonable alternates, they wrote, eventually bringing unanimity. </p><p>"Some cried and were comforted by other jurors. Many of us were completely exhausted. I remember seeing (one) in the corner of the room, muttering to herself. It was very tough, but it was the right verdict. </p><p>"There were no celebrations, no high fives, no congratulatory gestures," Guinasso continued. "These deliberations were thorough. If anything was going to condemn Scott Peterson, it was the legal process, not any one of us."</p></p><h2>The Circus is Coming (A Golden Classic)</h2><p>Step right up and see the dazzling displays and sensational sights of the brightest circus parade ever.

This is one of three of her finest biographical works to be reissued in the distinguished Virago Modern Classics series.Daphne du Maurier (1907-89) was born in London, the daughter of the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of George du Maurier, the author and artist. In 1931 her first novel, <i>The Loving Spirit</i>, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel <i>Rebecca </i>that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.<br>Many of du Maurier's bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock's <i>The Birds</i> and Nicolas Roeg's <i>Don't Look Now</i>.

Isherwood left Berlin in 1933, after Hitler came to power. For the next four years, he wandered around Europe-through Greece, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and France-with a German boy named Heinz.<br>The characters in the book include W.H.

Yeats was the twentieth-century heir of the Romantic poets and is considered by many to be the finest poet of the last hundred years. He was an artist whose long career and thematic and stylistic evolution eschewed the almost mythic tendency of Romanticism: he failed to flame briefly and die young, as did Keats, Shelley and Byron before him. This undoubtedly makes Yeats, the last unrepentant romantic, especially interesting, and the themes of human love and the ravages of time resultantly reverberate throughout his poetry. Living through a turbulent, violent epoch in Irish and European history, Yeats&#39; poetry can be seen as a creative reflection of its often hostile context - as a poet he is remarkable for bridging the gap between a backwards-looking appeal to Victorian sensuousness, and a modern hardness of edge and acerbity. Yeats believed that poetry is nothing less than ` the true voice of feeling&#39; . This selection, from his early lyricism to his more mature mysticism, shows a mind growing ever more adept at matching intense feeling with fully crafted art. The 32 poems selected in The Illustrated Poets: W.B. Yeats are accompanied by English and Irish paintings of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and cover every stage in his writing career. This compact anthology, with an introduction by Peter Porter, himself one of the most renowned poets of the second half of the twentieth-century, is a concise and valuable introduction to the last of the Romantics.</p><p>William Butler Yeats was an Irish poet and playwright, and one of the foremost figures of 20th century literature. A pillar of both the Irish and British literary establishments, in his later years he served as an Irish Senator for two terms. Yeats was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival and helped co-found the Abbey Theatre, where he served as its chief during its early years. In 1923 he became the first Irishman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p><h2>How to Make Your Own Picture Frames, Revised and Enlarged 3rd Edition</h2><p>Explicit instructions for making, finishing, and hanging various types of picture frames</p><p></p><h2>The New Penguin Book of English Verse</h2><p>This revolutionary collection abandons the traditional poet-by-poet approach of most anthologies, presenting seven centuries of English verse as an uninterrupted sequence of poems ordered according to their first individual appearance in the language.

She learned to sew and to knit. She helped her mother tend the garden. She learned to dye.1 She helped her father in the shop, doing the work that her brother hated, &#x201c;cutting Wick for the Candles, filling the Dipping Mold, and the Molds for cast Candles.&#x201d;2<br> &nbsp;<br> What more could she study? A Boston newspaper printed &#x201c;A Dialogue between a thriving Tradesman and his Wife about the Education of Their Daughter.&#x201d; The wife wishes to send the girl to school. The husband refuses, telling her:<br> &nbsp;<br> Prithee, good Madam, let her first be able,<br> To read a Chapter truly, in the Bible, <br> That she may&#x2019;nt mispronounce God&#x2019;s People, Popel, <br> Nor read Cunstable for Constantinople; <br> Make her expert and ready at her Prayers, <br> That God may keep her from the Devils Snares; <br> Teach her what&#x2019;s useful, how to shun deluding, <br> To roast, to toast, to boil and mix a Pudding. <br> To knit, to spin, to sew, to make or mend, <br> To scrub, to rub, to earn and not to spend, <br> I tell thee Wife, once more, I&#x2019;ll have her bred <br> To Book&#x2019;ry, Cook&#x2019;ry, Thimble, Needle, Thread.3<br> &nbsp;<br> That Jane Franklin learned to write as well as she did was a twist of fate: she was her brother&#x2019;s sister. Mostly, she learned other things. She was bred to bookery and cookery, needle and thread.<br> &nbsp;<br> She learned how to make soap. She once wrote down the family recipe. In a wooden box with a hole bored in the bottom and set over a tub filled with bricks, soak eighteen bushels of ashes and one bushel of lime with water. Leach lye. Then, in a copper pot, boil the lye with wax&#x2014;&#x201c;won third mirtle wax two thirds clean tallow the Greener the wax the beter,&#x201d; she wrote&#x2014;and keep it from boiling over &#x201c;by flirting the froith with a scimer.&#x201d; Stir in salt. &#x201c;Be carefull not to Put two much salt in it will make it Britle.&#x201d; Line a mold with a cloth (&#x201c;not too coars&#x201d;) and pour in the boiling soap: &#x201c;keep it smoth on the top take care to let your Frame stand on a Level let care be taken when it is in that it Is not Jogd.&#x201d; Let it set overnight, and in the morning cut it &#x201c;with a small wier fixed to a round stick at Each End.&#x201d; Use a gauge to make sure each cake is of equal weight and, if not, &#x201c;Pare it fitt.&#x201d;4<br> &nbsp;<br> She lived a life of confinement. She never learned to ride. (&#x201c;I hant courage to ride a hors,&#x201d; she once admitted.)5 If she left the city, it was with her mother, by boat, to visit the Folgers on Nantucket, where she played with her cousin Keziah.6 She spent her Sundays at the Old South Meeting House, listening to men&#x2019;s voices thundering from the pulpit. She ran errands, to the shops, to the docks, and to James&#x2019;s printing house, to visit her brothers. She visited her married sisters and helped care for their children, or they for her: some of her nieces and nephews were older than she was. She loved best her niece Grace.7<br> &nbsp;<br> Most days she spent at home, close to the fire. She was curious, and she could be untoward. But she was dutiful. She was pared to fit.<br> &nbsp;<br> A girl&#x2019;s apprenticeship was girlhood itself. A boy&#x2019;s apprenticeship was a trade. In 1717, when Jane was five, her brother James came back from England and set up a printing shop in Boston, &#x201c;over against the Prison in Queen Street.&#x201d;8 It was a godsend. Here at last was a trade for Benjamin, the bookish boy too poor to go to Harvard. In 1718, he became his brother&#x2019;s apprentice: a printer&#x2019;s devil. He moved into a room above James&#x2019;s shop. Benny was twelve; Jenny was six.<br> &nbsp;<br> The best part of his apprenticeship, Franklin always said, was the chance it gave him to read. At the Blue Ball, he had only ever found in his father&#x2019;s library a few books he liked: Plutarch&#x2019;s Lives, &#x201c;a Book of Defoe&#x2019;s called an Essay on Projects and another of Dr. Mather&#x2019;s call&#x2019;d Essays to do Good.&#x201d; But working at a printer&#x2019;s shop was almost as good as working at a bookshop. &#x201c;I now had Access to better Books,&#x201d; he remembered. &#x201c;An Acquaintance with the Apprentices of Booksellers, enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean. Often I sat up in my Room reading the greatest Part of the Night.&#x201d;9<br> &nbsp;<br> Jane Colman read all night long, too. Her father&#x2019;s house was stocked with books. She read &#x201c;all the English Poetry, and polite Pieces in Prose, printed and Manuscripts in her Father&#x2019;s well furnish&#x2019;d Library, and much she borrow&#x2019;d of her Friends and Acquaintance. She had indeed such a Thirst after Knowledge that the Leisure of the Day did not suffice, but she spent whole Nights in reading.&#x201d;10<br> &nbsp;<br> Jane Franklin enjoyed neither the leisure of a minister&#x2019;s daughter nor the library of a printer&#x2019;s apprentice. What books she read were what books she found in the house of a poor soap boiler. &#x201c;My Father&#x2019;s little Library consisted chiefly of Books in polemic Divinity,&#x201d; her brother had written. Her world of learning widened so far, and no farther.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her brother resolved to be his own tutor. Determined to become a good writer, he trained himself by reading. The boy who wanted to become the author of his own life taught himself to write by copying the prose style he found in the Spectator. &#x201c;I thought the Writing excellent, and wish&#x2019;d if possible to imitate it,&#x201d; he explained. He read an essay, wrote an abstract, and then rewrote the argument from the abstract, to see if he could improve on the original. Then he rewrote the essays as poems since, he thought, &#x201c;nothing acquaints a Lad so speedily with Variety of Expression, as the Necessity of finding such Words and Phrases as will suit with the Measure, Sound and Rhime of Verse, and at the same Time well express the Sentiment.&#x201d; He wrote rules, pledging himself to brevity (&#x201c;a multitude of Words obscure the Sense&#x201d;), clarity (&#x201c;To write clearly, not only the most expressive, but the plainest Words should be chosen&#x201d;), and simplicity: &#x201c;If a Man would that his Writings have an Effect on the Generality of Readers, he had better imitate that Gentleman, who would use no Word in his Works that was not well understood by his Cook-maid.&#x201d; His cook-maid . . . or his little sister.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Prose Writing has been of great Use to me in the Course of my Life,&#x201d; Franklin knew, &#x201c;and was a principal Means of my Advancement.&#x201d; He would write his way up, and out.11<br> &nbsp;<br> Reading, he grew skeptical of his family&#x2019;s faith. The more books he read, the less he believed the Bible. &#x201c;I was scarce 15,&#x201d; he remembered, &#x201c;when, after doubting by turns of several Points as I found them disputed in the different Books I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He discovered, too, that he liked to argue. &#x201c;My indiscrete Disputations about Religion began to make me pointed at with Horror by good People, as an Infidel or Atheist.&#x201d; He especially liked to debate, like &#x201c;University Men,&#x201d; with &#x201c;another Bookish Lad in the Town, John Collins by Name.&#x201d; They once debated &#x201c;the Propriety of educating the Female Sex in Learning, and their Abilities for Study.&#x201d; Young Collins &#x201c;was of Opinion that it was improper&#x201d; and that girls &#x201c;were naturally unequal to it.&#x201d; Franklin disagreed: &#x201c;I took the contrary Side, perhaps a little for Disputes sake.&#x201d;12<br> &nbsp;<br> In crafting his argument, Franklin leaned on Defoe&#x2019;s Essay on Projects, one of the few books in his father&#x2019;s library that he liked. Defoe had proposed the establishment of an &#x201c;Academy for Women&#x201d;: &#x201c;I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous Customs in the world, consider- ing us as a Civilised and a Christian Countrey, that we deny the advantages of Learning to Women.&#x201d; Like Astell, Defoe regretted the frivolousness of girls&#x2019; education: &#x201c;Their youth is spent to teach them to Stitch and Sew, or make Bawbles. They are taught to Read indeed, and perhaps to Write their Names, or so; and that is the heighth of a Woman&#x2019;s Education.&#x201d; His Academy for Women was to embrace every subject: &#x201c;To such whose Genius wou&#x2019;d lead them to it, I wou&#x2019;d deny no sort of Learning.&#x201d;13<br> &nbsp;<br> But, for all his Defoe, Franklin didn&#x2019;t win the argument. Collins, he admitted, &#x201c;was naturally more eloquent, had a ready Plenty of Words, and sometimes . . . bore me down more by his Fluency than by the Strength of his Reasons.&#x201d; They parted without settling the question and continued the debate by letters. &#x201c;Three or four Letters of a Side had pass&#x2019;d,&#x201d; Franklin wrote, &#x201c;when my Father happen&#x2019;d to find my Papers, and read them. Without entering into the Discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the Manner of my Writing, observ&#x2019;d that tho&#x2019; I had the Advantage of my Antagonist in correct Spelling and pointing (which I ow&#x2019;d to the Printing House) I fell far short in elegance of Expression, in Method and in Perspicuity.&#x201d;14<br> &nbsp;<br> Spelling and pointing (punctuating) were genteel accomplishments; they date to the rise of printing. People used to spell however they pleased, even spelling their own names differently from one day to the next. Then came the printing press, and rules for printers: how to spell, how to point. More books meant more readers; more readers meant more writers. But only the learned, only the lettered, knew how to spell.<br> &nbsp;<br> Franklin was a better speller than his friend Collins, and he could point better, too, but Collins proved a better debater. Be more precise, Josiah urged his son. Be plainer. On the question itself, he did not venture an opinion.<br> &nbsp;<br> While Benny was improving his writing by arguing about the education of girls, Jenny was at home, boiling soap and stitching. Quietly, with what time she could find, she did more. She once confided to her brother, &#x201c;I Read as much as I Dare.&#x201d;15<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. &#x201c;With all my own art &amp; good old unkle Benjamins memorandoms I cant make them good colors,&#x201d; JFM wrote to her brother in 1766, suggesting that, at least at that point, she had his book of memorandums, or recipes. JFM to BF, November 8, 1766. (And she certainly owned his books of poetry, one of which is inscribed with her name.)

And JFM, &#x201c;Recipe for Crown Soap,&#x201d; 1786, PBF, unpublished. I&#x2019;m not certain that the dates assigned to these recipes are especially plausible. The first seems to have been written down after the death of John Franklin, to whom JFM must have been referring when she wrote, &#x201c;My Brother in His Life time tould me it could not be conveyd by Recipt&#x201d; (that is, that you couldn&#x2019;t write down this recipe; you needed to learn by doing). The original is Jane Franklin Mecom, Recipe for Crown Soap, n.d., Hays Calendar IV, 376, Franklin Papers, vol. 58, folio 19. Van Doren credited the invention of crown soap to John Franklin, without any substantiation. But as Huang has remarked, there is every reason to believe that Josiah, who trained his son, was involved in perfecting the soap (&#x201c;Franklin&#x2019;s Father Josiah,&#x201d; 43&#x2013;45). And as Lemay argues, Abiah must have been involved (Life of BF, 1:56) and it&#x2019;s highly probable that Jane was intimately involved as well, which would also account for her subsequent frustration at her sons&#x2019; being kept out of the soap business. Jane herself gave some credit to her brother John. In one letter to Franklin, she refers to their brother John as &#x201c;the Inventor&#x201d; of crown soap, but in the same letter she explains that he had nearly as much difficulty getting it right as she did. &#x201c;The Labour is Grate, &amp; the operation critical, the Exact knolidg not to be attained without Expearance, my Brother Him self tould me it workd some times not to his mind in a way he could not account for&#x201d; (JFM to BF, December 29, 1780). When sending her own soap to Franklin in 1786, and apologizing that it wasn&#x2019;t exactly as fine as she had hoped, she wrote, &#x201c;I beleve my Brother John Perfectly understood the Exact proportion that would do best&#x201d; (JFM to BF, May 29, 1786). Yet this letter does not place John so far above herself, as a soap boiler; instead, it substantiates an argument that she and her brother knew very well how to make soap even if, at the age of sixty-four, she was having a hard time remembering the exact proportions to use.<br> 5. JFM to BF, September 12, 1779. <br> 6. Keziah Folger was born on Nantucket on October 9, 1723, when Jane was eleven. Keziah&#x2019;s father, Daniel Folger, was Abiah Folger Franklin&#x2019;s cousin, and her mother, Abigail Folger, was actually another cousin of Abiah Folger Franklin&#x2019;s. Useful information about Keziah Folger Coffin was gathered by Jared Sparks in the 1830s. In 1838, William Folger of Nantucket wrote to Sparks, about Franklin, that &#x201c;her parents being so nearly related to each other the Doctor used to say, that he considered Kezia as an own cousin.&#x201d; Jared Sparks, &#x201c;Papers sent to me by William C.

Two voices murmuring.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fetch Dr. Hargreaves.&#x201d;</p><p>A brief silence followed, during which she slowly became aware of a different layer of sound&#x2014;voices, muffled by distance, a car passing: it seemed, oddly, as if it were some way below her. She lay absorbing it, letting it crystallize, letting her mind play catch-up, as she recognized each for what it was.</p><p>It was at this point that she became aware of the pain. It forced its way upward in exquisite stages: first her arm, a sharp, burning sensation from elbow to shoulder, then her head: dull, relentless. The rest of her body ached, as it had done when she . . .</p><p>When she . . . ?</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be along in two ticks. He says to close the blinds.&#x201d;</p><p>Her mouth was so dry. She closed her lips and swallowed painfully. She wanted to ask for some water, but the words wouldn&#x2019;t come. She opened her eyes a little. Two indistinct shapes moved around her. Every time she thought she had worked out what they were, they moved again. Blue. They were blue.</p><p>&#x201c;You know who&#x2019;s just come in downstairs, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>One of the voices dropped. &#x201c;That singer. The one who looks like Paul Newman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought I heard something on the wireless about it. Lend me your thermometer, will you, Vi, mine&#x2019;s acting up again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to try and have a peek at him at lunchtime. Matron&#x2019;s had newspapermen outside all morning. I&#x2019;ll wager she&#x2019;s at her wits&#x2019; end.&#x201d;</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t understand what they were saying. The pain in her head had become a thumping, rushing sound, building in volume and intensity until all she could do was close her eyes again and wait for it, or her, to go away. Then the white came in, like a tide, to envelop her. With some gratitude she let out a silent breath and allowed herself to sink back into its embrace.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you awake, dear? You have a visitor.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a flickering reflection above her, a phantasm that moved briskly, first one way and then another. She had a sudden recollection of her first wristwatch, the way she had reflected sunlight through its glass casing onto the ceiling of the playroom, sending it backward and forward, making her little dog bark.</p><p>The blue was there again. She saw it move, accompanied by the swishing. And then there was a hand on her wrist, a brief spark of pain so that she yelped.</p><p>&#x201c;A little more carefully with that side, Nurse,&#x201d; the voice chided. &#x201c;She felt that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m terribly sorry, Dr. Hargreaves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The arm will require further surgery. We&#x2019;ve pinned it in several places, but it&#x2019;s not there yet.&#x201d;</p><p>A dark shape hovered near her feet. She willed it to solidify, but, like the blue shapes, it refused to do so, and she let her eyes close.</p><p>&#x201c;You can sit with her, if you like. Talk to her. She&#x2019;ll be able to hear you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How are her . . . other injuries?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be some scarring, I&#x2019;m afraid. Especially on that arm. And she took quite a blow to the head, so it may be a while before she&#x2019;s &nbsp;herself again. But given the severity of the accident, I think we can say she&#x2019;s had a rather lucky escape.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a brief silence.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Someone had placed a bowl of fruit beside her. She had opened her eyes again, her gaze settling on it, letting the shape, the color, solidify until she grasped, with a stab of satisfaction, that she could identify what was there.&nbsp;<i>Grapes</i>, she said. And again, rolling the silent word around the inside of her head:&nbsp;<i>grapes</i>. It felt important, as if it were anchoring her in this new reality.</p><p>And then, as quickly as they had come, they were gone, obliterated by the dark blue mass that had settled beside her. As it moved closer, she could just make out the faint scent of tobacco. The voice, when it came, was tentative, perhaps a little embarrassed, even. &#x201c;Jennifer? Jennifer? Can you hear me?&#x201d; The words were so loud; strangely intrusive.</p><p>&#x201c;Jenny, dear, it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;</p><p>She wondered if they would let her see the grapes again. It seemed necessary that she did; blooming, purple, solid. Familiar.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure she can hear me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quite sure, but she may find communicating rather exhausting to begin with.&#x201d;</p><p>There was some murmuring that she couldn&#x2019;t make out. Or perhaps she just stopped trying.</p><p>Nothing seemed clear. &#x201c;Can . . . you . . . ,&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;But her mind wasn&#x2019;t damaged? In the crash? You know that there will be no . . . lasting ... ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As I said, she took a good bump to the head, but there were no medical signs for alarm.&#x201d; The sound of shuffled papers. &#x201c;No fracture. No swelling to the brain. But these things are always a little unpredictable, and patients are affected quite differently. So, you&#x2019;ll just need to be a little&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please . . .&#x201d; Her voice was a murmur, barely audible.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Hargreaves! I do believe she&#x2019;s trying to speak.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;. . . want to see . . .&#x201d;</p><p>A face swam down to her. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;. . . want to see . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>The grapes,</i>&nbsp;she was begging<i>. I just want to see those grapes again.</i></p><p>&#x201c;She wants to see her husband!&#x201d; The nurse sprang upward as she announced this triumphantly. &#x201c;I think she wants to see her husband.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a pause, then someone stooped toward her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here, dear. Everything is . . . everything&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;</p><p>The body retreated, and she heard the pat of a hand on a back. &#x201c;There, you see? She&#x2019;s getting back to herself already. All in good time, eh?&#x201d; A man&#x2019;s voice again. &#x201c;Nurse? Go and ask Sister to organize some food for tonight. Nothing too substantial. Something light and easy to swallow. . . . Perhaps you could fetch us a cup of tea while you&#x2019;re there.&#x201d; She heard footsteps, low voices, as they continued to talk beside her. Her last thought as the light closed in again was, Husband<i>?</i></p><p>Later, when they told her how long she had been in the hospital, she could barely believe it. Time had become fragmented, unmanageable, arriving and departing in chaotic clumps of hours. It was Tuesday breakfast. Now it was Wednesday lunchtime. She had apparently slept for eighteen hours&#x2014;this was said with some disapproval, as if there were an implied rudeness in being absent for so long. And then it was Friday. Again.</p><p>Sometimes when she woke it was dark, and she would push her head up a little against the starched white pillow and watch the soothing movements of the ward at night; the soft-shoe shuffle of the nurses moving up and down the corridors, the occasional murmur of conversation between nurse and patient. She could watch television in the evenings if she liked, the nurses told her. Her husband was paying for private care&#x2014;she could have almost anything she liked. She always said, No, thank you: she was confused enough by the unsettling torrent of information without the endless chatter of the box in the corner.</p><p>As the periods of wakefulness stretched and grew in number, she became familiar with the faces of the other women on the little ward. The older woman in the room to her right, whose jet-black hair was &nbsp;pinned immaculately in a rigid, sprayed sculpture upon her head, her features fixed in an expression of mild, surprised disappointment. She had apparently been in a moving picture when she was young, and would deign to tell any new nurse about it. She had a commanding voice, and few visitors. There was the plump young woman in the room opposite, who cried quietly in the early hours of the morning. A brisk, older woman&#x2014;a nanny perhaps?&#x2014;brought young children in to see her for an hour every evening. The two boys would climb onto the bed, clutching at her, until the nanny told them to get down for fear they would &#x201c;do your mother an injury.&#x201d;</p><p>The nurses told her the other women&#x2019;s names, and occasionally their own, but she couldn&#x2019;t remember them. They were disappointed in her, she suspected.</p><p>Your Husband, as everyone referred to him, came most evenings. He wore a well-cut suit, dark blue or gray serge, gave her a perfunctory kiss on the cheek, and usually sat at the foot of her bed. He would make small talk solicitously, asking how she was finding the food, whether she would like him to have anything else sent along. Occasionally he would simply read a newspaper.</p><p>He was a handsome man, perhaps ten years older than she was, with a high, noble forehead and serious, hooded eyes. She knew, at some deep level, that he must be who he said he was, that she was married to him, but it was perplexing to feel nothing when everyone so obviously expected a different reaction. Sometimes she would stare at him when he wasn&#x2019;t looking, waiting for some jolt of familiarity to kick in. Sometimes, when she woke, she would find him sitting there, newspaper lowered, gazing at her as if he felt something similar.</p><p>Dr. Hargreaves, the attending physician, came daily, checking her charts, asking if she could tell him the day, the time, her name. She always got those right now. She even managed to tell him the prime minister was Mr. Macmillan and her age, twenty-seven. But she struggled with newspaper headlines, with events that had taken place before she arrived here. &#x201c;It will come,&#x201d; he would say, patting her hand. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to force it, there&#x2019;s a good girl.&#x201d;</p><p>And then there was her mother, who brought little gifts&#x2014;soap, nice &nbsp;shampoo, magazines&#x2014;as if they would nudge her into a semblance of who she apparently used to be. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all been so worried, Jenny darling,&#x201d; she said, laying a cool hand on her head. It felt nice. Not familiar, but nice. Occasionally her mother would begin to say something, then mutter, &#x201c;I mustn&#x2019;t tire you out with questions. Everything will come back. That&#x2019;s what the doctors say. So you mustn&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t worried, Jenny wanted to tell her. It was quite peaceful in her little bubble. She just felt a vague sadness that she couldn&#x2019;t be the person everyone evidently expected her to be. It was at this point, when the thoughts got too confusing, that she would invariably fall asleep again.</p><p>They finally told her she was going home on a morning so crisp that the trails of smoke broke into the blue sky above the capital like a spindly forest. By then she could walk around the ward occasionally, swapping magazines with the other patients, who would be chatting to the nurses, sometimes listening to the wireless, if they felt so inclined. She had had a second operation on her arm and it was healing well, they told her, although the long red scar where the plate had been inserted made her wince, and she tried to keep it hidden under a long sleeve. Her eyes had been tested, her hearing checked; her skin had healed after the myriad scratches caused by fragments of glass. The bruises had faded, and her broken rib and collarbone had knitted well enough for her to lie in a variety of positions without pain.</p><p>To all intents and purposes, she looked, they claimed, like &#x201c;her old self,&#x201d; as if saying it enough times might make her remember who that was. Her mother, meanwhile, spent hours rummaging through piles of black-and-white photographs so that she could reflect Jennifer&#x2019;s life back at her.</p><p>She learned that she had been married for four years. There were no children&#x2014;from her mother&#x2019;s lowered voice, she guessed this was a source of some disappointment to everyone. She lived in a very smart house in a very good part of London, with a housekeeper and a driver, and plenty of young ladies would apparently give their eyeteeth to &nbsp;have half of what she had. Her husband was something big in mining and was often away, although his devotion was such that he had put off several very important trips since the accident. From the deference with which the medical staff spoke to him, she guessed he was indeed quite important and, by extension, that she might expect a degree of respect, too, even if it felt nonsensical to her.</p><p>Nobody had said much about how she had got there, although she had once sneaked a look at the doctor&#x2019;s notes and knew that she had been in a car accident. On the one occasion she had pressed her mother about what had happened, she had gone quite pink and, placing her plump little hand on Jennifer&#x2019;s, had urged her &#x201c;not to dwell on it, dear. It&#x2019;s all been . . . terribly upsetting.&#x201d; Her eyes had filled with tears, and not wanting to upset her, Jennifer had moved on.</p><p>A chatty girl with a bright orange helmet of hair came from another part of the hospital to trim and set Jennifer&#x2019;s hair. This, the young woman told her, would make her feel a lot better. Jennifer had lost a little hair at the back of her head&#x2014;it had been shaved off for a wound to be stitched&#x2014;and the girl announced that she was a wonder at hiding such injuries.</p><p>A little more than an hour later she held up a mirror with a flourish. Jennifer stared at the girl who stared back at her. Quite pretty, she thought, with a kind of distant satisfaction. Bruised, a little pale, but an agreeable face. My face, she corrected herself.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have your cosmetics on hand?&#x201d; the hairdresser said. &#x201c;I could do your face for you, if your arm&#x2019;s still sore. Bit of lipstick will brighten any face, madam. That and some Pan-Cake.&#x201d;</p><p>Jennifer kept staring at the mirror. &#x201c;Do you think I should?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes. A pretty girl like you. I can make it very subtle . . . but it&#x2019;ll put a glow into your cheeks. Hold on, I&#x2019;ll pop downstairs and get my kit. I&#x2019;ve got some lovely colors from Paris, and a Charles of the Ritz lipstick that&#x2019;ll be perfect on you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t you look fetching? It&#x2019;s good to see a lady with her makeup on. Shows us that you&#x2019;re a little more on top of things,&#x201d; Dr. Hargreaves said on his rounds, some time later. &#x201c;Looking forward to going home, are we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, thank you,&#x201d; she said politely. She had no idea how to convey to him that she didn&#x2019;t know what that home was.</p><p>He studied her face for a moment, perhaps gauging her uncertainty. Then he sat on the side of her bed and laid a hand on her shoulder. &#x201c;I understand it must all seem a little disconcerting, that you might not feel quite yourself yet, but don&#x2019;t be too concerned if lots of things are unclear&#x201d;. It&#x2019;s quite common to get amnesia after a head injury.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a very supportive family, and I&#x2019;m sure once you&#x2019;re surrounded by familiar things, your old routines, friends, shopping trips, and the like, you&#x2019;ll find that it&#x2019;s all popping back into place.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded obediently. She had worked out pretty quickly that everyone seemed happier if she did so.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, I&#x2019;d like you to come back in a week so that I can check the progress of that arm. You&#x2019;ll need some physiotherapy to recover the full use of it. But the main thing is simply for you to rest and not worry too much about anything. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>He was already preparing to leave. What else could she say?</p><p>Her husband picked her up shortly before teatime. The nurses had lined up in the downstairs reception area to say good-bye to her, bright as pins in their starched pinafores. She still felt curiously weak and unsteady on her feet, and was grateful for the arm that he held out to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for the care you&#x2019;ve shown my wife.

Find out what two of the top authors of their genres have to say about their characters, writing process, and more. Janet Evanovich is the bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum novels, including <i>Finger Lickin' Fifteen</i>, twelve romance novels, the Alexandra Barnaby novels, and <i>How I Write: Secrets of a Bestselling Author</i>. Read on to see Janet Evanovich's questions for Michael Connelly, or turn the tables to see what Connelly asked Evanovich. </p><p> <b>Evanovich</b>: So dude,... Okay, you're back in Florida. Do you ever get to the beach? And when and if you get to the beach...is Harry Bosch with you? And what kind of beachwear are you guys sporting? Flip-flops? Crocs? Speedo? Board shorts?</p><p> <b>Connelly</b>: I go to the beach often on weekends. Board shorts are required and I wear flip-flops with the built in bottle opener. Comes in handy. In Florida we rarely have waves, unless there is a hurricane in the Gulf. So I have taken up paddle-boarding, which essentially involves a big surfboard that you stand on and paddle. Still a balancing act, but easier than surfing, and you don't need waves.</p><p> <b>Evanovich</b>: What will a bookstore look like in 2020? Will we all be downloading?</p><p> <b>Connelly</b>: Good question. Since it is only eleven years from now, I think there will still be a solid population of "old school" readers who need the book in their hands. The question is, will they get it at a bookstore or will we have a Kindle 9.0 device that manufactures a book for you at home, complete with photo of author in a bomber jacket.</p><p> <b>Evanovich</b>: If everybody is downloading in 2020 what the heck will we be signing on book tour? Body parts? Kindle cases?</p><p> <b>Connelly</b>: I signed two Kindles yesterday. One person asked me to leave room for signatures from you and Dennis Lehane. So next time you're in Seattle she'll be in your line.</p><p> <b>Evanovich</b>: Do you eat when you write? Beer nuts? M&amp;Ms? Just coffee? What keeps you from falling out of the chair in a narcoleptic stupor?</p><p> <b>Connelly</b>: Have you ever seen what eating Cheetos can do to a keyboard? I have to say I am addicted to Coke. I always have a glass of it nearby. I eat a lot of candy, too. Keeps me going. Smarties are a great writing tool. I often need to raid my daughter's stash and then there is trouble on the home front.</p><p> <b>Evanovich</b>: Are you a messy guy or a neat guy? Do you keep clutter on your desk? In your head? Are there soda cans and crumpled fast food wrappers rolling around on the floor of your car?</p><p> <b>Connelly</b>: I keep a clean car but a desk that gets progressively messier as I write a book. When I am finished with the book, I clean up the desk&#x2014;and eat all the stray Smarties found under the paperwork. The clean desk then promotes the start of the next book.</p><p> <b>Evanovich</b>: The new book, <i>The Scarecrow</i> sounds terrific, and I know it's followed by Harry Bosch in <i>Nine Dragons</i> in the fall. Does your publisher prefer one series over another? And do you find one series to be more commercially viable than another?</p><p> <b>Connelly</b>: They let me do what I want. I like writing about Harry Bosch and he's pretty popular, but usually when I write a standalone it widens the audience a bit.</p><p> <b>Evanovich</b>: Want to meet me in a bar in Ft. Myers? Is that halfway?</p><p> <b>Connelly</b>: Name the place. </p><p> </p><b>Michael Connelly</b> is the author of twenty-nine novels, including <i>#1 New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Wrong Side of Goodbye </i>and <i>The Crossing</i><i>.</i> His books, which include the Harry Bosch series and Lincoln Lawyer series, have sold more than sixty million copies worldwide. Connelly is a former newspaper reporter who has won numerous awards for his journalism and his novels and is the executive producer of <i>Bosch,</i> starring Titus Welliver. He spends his time in California and Florida.</p><h2>Wallace Stevens: Words Chosen Out of Desire</h2><p>In this graceful book, Helen Vendler brings her remarkable skills to bear on a number of Stevens&#x2019;s short poems. She shows us that this most intellectual of poets is in fact the most personal of poets; that his words are not devoted to epistemological questions alone but are also &#x201c;words chosen out of desire.&#x201d;</p><p>Helen Vendler is A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University.&#x201c;[This book] tells the reader a good deal more about Wallace Stevens&#x2019;s poetry and Stevens as a poet than many a weighty tome... The shining merit of these lectures is their capacity to elucidate single poems, some familiar anthology pieces, others much less familiar, so that they stand alone as comprehensible entities. The key to this success is the devotion that has accompanied her patience, a devotion that responds, in particular, to the warmth and sadness, the emotional depth, that Vendler finds in Stevens... Those readers who have sensed both the urgency of feeling and the forlornness in Stevens&#x2019;s poems, but have found the obliquities of his manner and diction often impenetrable, will be grateful for the tact and moderation of these fresh interpretations. Their special achievements are that they convince, movingly and with a simplicity not often found in Stevens commentary, and that they then leave the poem to reassemble in the mind as wholly itself.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lucy Beckett</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Vendler] has found the right way to talk about [Stevens], and is quite right to say that he is a genuinely misunderstood poet. On the very late poems she is exceptionally good and provides some reasons for the belief (which I share) that they are great poems indeed... She writes throughout with admirable firmness... Altogether this little book seems to me a triumph.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Frank Kermode</b></p><h2>Beyond the Mexique Bay</h2><p>The author describes his experiences traveling through the Caribbean to Guatemala and southern Mexico in 1933</p><p></p><h2>The Nine Lives of Charlotte Taylor: The First Woman Settler of the Miramichi</h2><p>The epic true story of Charlotte Taylor, as told by her great-great-great-granddaughter, one of Canada&#x2019;s foremost journalists.<br><br>In 1775, twenty-year-old Charlotte Taylor fled her English country house with her lover, the family&#x2019;s black butler. To escape the fury of her father, they boarded a ship for the West Indies, but ten days after reaching shore, Charlotte&#x2019;s lover died of yellow fever, leaving her alone and pregnant in Jamaica. <br><br>Undaunted, Charlotte swiftly made an alliance with a British naval commodore, who plied a trading route between the islands and British North America, and travelled north with him. She landed at the Baie de Chaleur, in what is present-day New Brunswick, where she found refuge with the Mi&#x2019;kmaq and birthed her baby. In the sixty-six years that followed, she would have three husbands, nine more children and a lifelong relationship with an aboriginal man. <br><br>Charlotte Taylor lived in the front row of history, walking the same paths as the expelled Acadians, the privateers of the British-American War and the newly arriving Loyalists. In a rough and beautiful landscape, she struggled to clear and claim land, and battled the devastating epidemics that stalked her growing family. Using a seamless blend of fact and fiction, Charlotte Taylor&#x2019;s great-great-great-granddaughter, Sally Armstrong, reclaims the life of a dauntless and unusual woman and delivers living history with all the drama and sweep of a novel.<br><br>Excerpt from from <b>The Nine Lives of Charlotte Taylor</b>:<br><br><i>&#x201c;Every summer of my youth, we would travel from the family cottage at Youghall Beach to visit my mother&#x2019;s extended clan in Tabusintac near the Miramichi River. And at every gathering, just as much as there would be chickens to chase and newly cut hay to leap in, so there would be an ample serving of stories about Charlotte Taylor. . .<br><br>She was a woman with a &#x201c;past.&#x201d; The potboilers about her ran like serials from summer to summer, at weddings and funerals and whenever the clan came together. She wasn&#x2019;t exactly presented as a gentlewoman, although it was said that she came from an aristocratic family in England. Nor was there much that seemed genteel about the person they always referred to as &#x201c;old Charlotte.&#x201d; Words like &#x201c;lover&#x201d; and &#x201c;land grabber&#x201d; drifted down from the supper table to where we kids sat on the floor. There were whoops of laughter at her indiscretions, followed by sideways glances at us. But for all the stories passed around, it was clear the family still had a powerful respect for a woman long dead. We owed our very existence to her, and the anecdotes the older generation told suggested that their own fortitude and guile were family traits passed down from the ancestral matriarch. For as long as I can remember, I&#x2019;ve tried to imagine the real life Charlotte Taylor lived and, more, how she ever survived.&#x201d;</i></p><p><p>SALLY ARMSTRONG is an Amnesty International award winner, a member of the Order of Canada, holder of 7 honourary degrees, a teacher, journalist, human rights activist, and contributor to <i>Maclean's</i>, <i>Chatelaine</i> and the CBC.

Charlotte Taylor is at the rail, rivetted to the huge square sails puffing out like bullies in the wind and bucking the ship into the open sea. A tall woman with �flame-�red hair tied in a knot at her neck, she keeps her eye to the bow as if setting her own course and her back to the land she has left behind. Standing beside her at the rail is Pad Willisams, her lover and �co-�conspirator in the hurried exit from Charlotte&#x2019;s family, Pad&#x2019;s job as butler in the Taylor household and a truth they each had only a part �of.<br><br>A hastily packed trunk is stowed with the cargo. The calico sack she&#x2019;d prepared for the voyage, and now realizes is pathetically inadequate since the trunk cannot be opened again until they reach shore six to eight weeks from now, is slung over her �back.<br><br>A scrofulous man of indiscriminate age eyes her repeatedly from his place by the forward capstan. He&#x2019;s one of the woebegone collection of humanity she&#x2019;s travelling �with&#x2013;�mostly men in their twenties and thirties and one young boy with freckles on his nose who seems to be in the employ of the haughty Captain Skinner. They all stare shamelessly at the white woman and the black man by her side. Pad has pulled together all the stiff dignity of the butler he had been just days earlier, but she can feel the anxiety that thrums through him. She is somewhat surprised to realize that she isn&#x2019;t daunted by the stares, the days ahead or the consequences of leaving her family&#x2019;s country home outside of London. Standing in the brisk wind on the deck of a sailing ship just a week after her twentieth birthday, Charlotte Taylor is �unafraid&#x2013;�maybe even �elated.<br><br>She&#x2019;s still leaning on the portside, watching the water, letting the wind blow on her face when she allows herself to cast her thoughts to what she has run away from. The terrible row with her father when he learned she&#x2019;d been &#x201c;consorting,&#x201d; as he called it, with Pad. The endless rounds of tea, the suffocating rules and her mother&#x2019;s predictable attacks of the vapours whenever there was a hint of excitement in the household. She smiles in anticipation of the life ahead. A marriage to the dashing Pad, a home in the tropics. She&#x2019;s grinning at the prospects when Pad interrupts her reverie to suggest they go below and secure their living �quarters.<br><br>The quarters are cramped; the ceiling is so low they have to duck their heads. The bunks are arranged in two rows, one on each side of the dreary lower deck with damp curtains hanging between them to lend an illusion of privacy. There are hooks on which to hang their possessions and a lopsided stove in the centre. The only light and fresh air is from the hatch to the upper deck; the quarters smell of mildew and rotten wood. Indeed, the black streaks of rot crawling up the legs of the cots speak of the months at sea, the flourishing business of carrying human and other cargo across the ocean as many times as the weather will allow between May and October, never stopping long enough to refit or �repair.<br><br>They pick a bunk at the end of the row and tie their sacks to the hooks before exploring the rest of the lower deck. There are stalls toward the stern filled with �animals&#x2013;�two steers, four sheep, a ragged flock of chickens and three fat pigs. Charlotte looks at each and lingers on the soft, uncomprehending eyes of the steers that will become meals for the passengers and crew. Tucked under the bow in a �wedge-�shaped hold are the ship&#x2019;s �stores&#x2013;�burlap sacks of flour, sugar and grain, cases of biscuits, salt and limes. Charlotte and Pad walk back to midship, where a wide hatch is battened shut on the �deck.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s down there?&#x201d; Charlotte asks a stocky sailor who is hurrying �aft.<br><br>&#x201c;Cargo, madam,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Plenty a&#x2019; cotton cloth and wool. That&#x2019;s what makes &#x2019;em rich, madam, shippin&#x2019; the likes a&#x2019; that.&#x201d;<br><br>My trunk is down there too, Charlotte thinks �ruefully.<br><br>The young lad who&#x2019;d caught her eye when they left the dock is friendly, puppyish and not too shy to tell her his name is Tommy Yates when she finds him exploring the lower �deck.<br><br>&#x201c;Me dad was the one who got me on board,&#x201d; the boy confides gravely. &#x201c;He brought me to the dock and hired me out to the captain. He told him I was sixteen, an&#x2019; I&#x2019;m but thirteen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thirteen?&#x201d; Charlotte looks at him closely. &#x201c;Are you even that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes, madam. Honest, I am.&#x201d;<br><br>She had thought him no more than a scrawny �eleven.<br><br>When he is not scrambling up the rigging at the captain&#x2019;s orders or crawling through the hold below the sleeping quarters to fetch something the captain needs from the cargo, Tommy finds his way to Charlotte&#x2019;s side. In the first week at sea, she heard about his fourteen brothers and sisters, the drink that made his father what he was and the mother who was so sickly she could hardly manage to stagger from her �bed.<br><br>Charlotte shares her own story with �him&#x2013;�putting a more varnished spin on her departure than is the case. She tells Tommy that she and Pad are married and that her father, General Taylor, doesn&#x2019;t approve of the relationship so they decided to leave home for the West Indies and start a new �life.<br><br>She entertains the winsome boy with details of the world she left behind, imitating her nanny&#x2019;s priggish etiquette. &#x201c;She insisted I sit like this all day long,&#x201d; says Charlotte, perching herself on a bench and exaggerating the �pose&#x2013;�her back ramrod straight, her legs bent at the knee and turned slightly sideways and her hands folded together in her lap. She makes him laugh when she describes her antics in the straitlaced �household&#x2013;�refusing to marry the man her mother had chosen for her, looking contrite when her father admonished her, galloping around the estate on her horse and lingering at the stable with Pad. Tommy thinks it&#x2019;s a blissful life she&#x2019;s left, but even this boy can see the rebel in the woman he has �befriended</p><h2>In the Company of Bears</h2><p>In the Company of Bears A Celebration for the Centenary of the Teddy Bear</p><p></p><h2>Bryant &amp; May off the Rails: A Peculiar Crimes Unit Mystery</h2><p>1st Bantam 2011 edition paperback fine book In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p></p><h2>Power and Imagination: City-States in Renaissance Italy</h2><p>Analyzes the development of the great city-states of Italy from the eleventh to the sixteenth century, as small market towns grew into independent centers of power and culture</p><p>Lauro Martines is a professor emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles.<p>"[A] brilliant study... of the extraordinary explosion of expression in art and scholarship which made Italy the model for Europe."</p> (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)</p><h2>The Original Black Elite: Daniel Murray and the Story of a Forgotten Era</h2><p><p>In this outstanding cultural biography, the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>A Slave in the White House</em> chronicles a critical yet overlooked chapter in American history: the inspiring rise and calculated fall of the black elite, from Emancipation through Reconstruction to the Jim Crow Era&#x2014;embodied in the experiences of an influential figure of the time, academic, entrepreneur, and political activist and black history pioneer Daniel Murray.</p><p>In the wake of the Civil War, Daniel Murray, born free and educated in Baltimore, was in the vanguard of Washington, D.C.&#x2019;s black upper class. Appointed Assistant Librarian at the Library of Congress&#x2014;at a time when government appointments were the most prestigious positions available for blacks&#x2014;Murray became wealthy through his business as a construction contractor and married a college-educated socialite. The Murrays&#x2019; social circles included some of the first African-American U.S. Senators and Congressmen, and their children went to the best colleges&#x2014;Harvard and Cornell.</p><p>Though Murray and other black elite of his time were primed to assimilate into the cultural fabric as Americans first and people of color second, their prospects were crushed by Jim Crow segregation and the capitulation to white supremacist groups by the government, which turned a blind eye to their unlawful&#x2014;often murderous&#x2014;acts. Elizabeth Dowling Taylor traces the rise, fall, and&nbsp;disillusionment of upper-class African Americans, revealing that they were a representation not of hypothetical achievement but what could be realized by African Americans through education and equal opportunities. </p><p>As she makes clear, these well-educated and wealthy elite were living proof that African Americans did not lack ability to fully participate in the social contract as white supremacists claimed, making their subsequent fall when Reconstruction was prematurely abandoned all the more tragic. Illuminating and powerful, her magnificent work brings to life a dark chapter of American history that too many Americans have yet to recognize.</p></p><p><p>This cultural biography tells the enthralling story of the high-achieving black elites who thrived in the nation&#x2019;s capital during Reconstruction. Daniel Murray (1851&#x2014;1925), an assistant librarian at the Library of Congress, was a prominent member of this glorious class.<strong></strong></p><p>Murray&#x2019;s life was reflective of those who were well-off at the time. This social circle included African American educators, ministers, lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, US senators and representatives, and other government officials. Among the luminaries were Francis and Archibald Grimk�, Blanche Bruce, Pinckney Pinchback, Robert and Mary Church Terrell, Booker T. Washington, and W. E. B. DuBois. The elite were primed to assimilate into the cultural fabric as Americans first and people of color second. Education was a pearl of great pride, and they sent their children to the best schools&#x2014;Phillips Academy, Cornell, and Harvard. They belonged to exclusive clubs, cultivated genteel manners, owned opulent homes, threw elaborate parties, dressed to the nines, and summered in special enclaves.</p><p>The rug was pulled from under all African Americans when they were betrayed by the federal government as the cost of reconciliation with the South. With their education, refinement, and accomplishments, the elite had only further to fall. In response to renewed oppression, Murray and others in his class fought back, establishing themselves as inspiring race activists. Elizabeth Dowling Taylor&#x2019;s powerful work brings to light a dark chapter of race relations that too many have yet to own.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth Dowling Taylor</strong> is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>A Slave in the White House: Paul Jennings and the Madisons</em>. She received her PhD from the University of California at Berkeley, and over her twenty-two-year career in museum education and research has held the positions of director of interpretation at Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s Monticello and director of education at James Madison&#x2019;s Montpelier. She is now an independent scholar and lecturer and a fellow at the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities in Charlottesville.</p></p><h2>In Search of Frankenstein</h2><p>Relates an investigation into the origins of Mary Shelley&#39;s novel and reviews the treatment of its theme on the stage and screen</p><p>Florescu (emeritus, European history, Boston Coll.) covers very little new material in his examination of the myths behind the creation of Shelley's famous novel. Most chapters rehash extensively studied topics, although "Castle Frankenstein and the Alchemist Dippel" does offer some original ideas about the Frankenstein family. Florescu develops a thesis based on "what ifs" surrounding the infamous summer of 1816 and the Byron-Shelley coterie. Although the work includes images of the Shelley circle as well as an impressive Frankenstein filmography, the comprehensive bibliography of sources is rarely alluded to, enhancing the sense that this work is speculative in nature. Florescu aimed to write something that fell between an academic and a popular study, but this doesn't really work as either. Recommended only for large public libraries and academic libraries in which many undergraduates study Frankenstein.?Kim Woodbridge, "The Scientist," Philadelphia<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chicken Soup for the Soul: 101 Stories to Open the Heart and Rekindle the Spirit</h2><p><strong>The Original #1 New York Times Bestseller, more than 8 million copies sold!<br></strong><br>Rediscover the power of inspiration with timeless stories about the everyday miracles that illuminate the best of the human spirit.

Some of the authors are famous, such as Dan Millman, who writes an exquisite vignette on "Courage," and Gloria Steinem, who writes of "The Royal Knights of Harlem."

But Bento jealously suspects that their son is not his. But beyond this straightforward plot, Machado plays with the reader&#39;s expectations and comments on the structure of the story, blurring the line between fiction and reality and appearing very modern.</p><p>The unreliable narrator and the fictional memoir are long-standing literary traditions. Nineteenth-century Brazilian author Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis uses both to brilliant effect in his novel <i>Dom Casmurro</i>. Narrated by Bento Santiago, this memoir looks back over a life filled with the suspicion of betrayal: Bento is convinced that his wife had an affair with his best friend, and that his son was the result of it. Though he has no real evidence to support this belief, Bento becomes so obsessed with it that, in the end, he commits crimes far worse than the suspected adultery to avenge himself. The memoir itself is a kind of justification for his actions; Bento, now alone, recreates the environment of his childhood and attempts to rewrite the facts of his life--in essence, reconstructing the past. <p> Among readers familiar with Latin American literature, Machado is considered a master. His novels blend black comedy with deadly accurate social commentary and an unerring perception of human psychology to create works that are brilliant, complex without being opaque, and joys to read. The Oxford University Press edition is ably translated by John Gledson and accompanied by critical essays that will help orient readers unfamiliar with Machado's work.</p><p>Praise for author Machado de Assis</p><p>"[Machado de Assis] is a great ironist, a tragic comedian. In his books, in their most comic moments, he underlines the suffering by making us laugh."&#x2015;Philip Roth</p><p>"Machado de Assis is a kind of miracle." &#x2015;Harold Bloom</p><p>"I am astonished that a writer of such greatness does not yet occupy the place he deserves." &#x2015;Susan Sontag</p><p>"Machado retrieves from Cervantes the origins of the novel as illusion, play, ambiguity and adventure."&#x2015;K.

Linking together the music of J.S. Bach, the graphic art of Escher and the mathematical theorems of Godel, as well as ideas drawn from logic, biology, psychology, physics and linguistics, Douglas Hofstadter illuminates one of the greatest mysteries of modern science: the nature of human thought processes. &#39;Every few decades an unknown author brings outa book of such depth, clarity, range, wit, beauty and originality that it is recognized at once as a major literary event. This is such a work&#39; - Martin Gardner.</p><p>Everything is a symbol, and symbols can combine to form patterns. Patterns are beautiful and revelatory of larger truths. These are the central ideas in the thinking of Kurt G�del, M.C. Escher, and Johann Sebastian Bach, perhaps the three greatest minds of the past quarter-millennium.

Though Lewis and Clark blazed a narrow corridor of geographical reality, the West remained largely terra incognita until trappers and traders--Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, Tom Fitzpatrick, Jedediah Smith--opened paths through the snow-choked mountain wilderness. They opened the way west to Fremont and played a major role in the pivotal years of 1845-1848 when Texas was annexed, the Oregon question was decided, and the Mexican War ed with the Southwest and California in American hands, the Pacific Ocean becoming our western boundary.<br></p><p>It&#39;s true, Robert Utley writes, that mountain men such as &#34;Crazy Bill&#34; Williams and Jeremiah &#34;Liver-Eating&#34; Johnson were an unlearned, unwashed, drunk, and violent bunch who tore a bloody swath across the then-unconquered American West from the 1810s to the 1840s. Yet their travels across deserts and plains and over high mountains yielded a huge body of geographical knowledge that would enable American pioneers to cross the Mississippi and traverse the continent in relative security. Utley, a historian with a fluent narrative style, tells the stories of hard-fighting men like Jim Bridger, Benjamin Bonneville, Kit Carson, and Joseph Walker, whose names now figure prominently on maps of the region but are otherwise little remembered.Former historian to the National Park Service, Robert M.

The implications of such an outcome for the region and the world are stark: a very fanatical militarized Islamist region that soon might be armed with nuclear weapons to threaten the world with atomic terrorism and the same insidious conditions that promote Christian genocide there could spread to America. Reversing this very serious threat must be the top priority for Middle East governments and their populations, the so-called moderate Muslim world, Western governments already frightened by rising Islamist threats and a genuine global response by Christians to rise-up around a doctrine that combines moral, civic and Christian virtue as the guiding light of future political and Christian social action in the Middle East.There are plenty of clues in God&#39;s word about the geopolitical clashes of culture and religion seen today and on close examination there are a host of indicators that suggest, yes, events are building to an apocalyptic crescendo. It appears that the last days are rapidly approaching.The evidence contained in NEVER SUBMIT ultimately demands a clarion call for people across the world to launch a campaign that not only saves Middle East Christians from genocide but also saves the rest of the world from Islamic extremists. That campaign is called &#34;Never Submit,&#34; a response to Islam defined as &#34;submission&#34; and to Islamists who give Middle East Christians three choices: leave, convert or die. The &#34;Never Submit&#34; campaign calls on Christian statesman across the world to rise up and lead fellow believers and the community of nations in a righteous way to eliminate the threat posed by Islamic extremism and to call all people to include pragmatic Muslims to moral accountability and action.</p><p></p><h2>The Incredible Scofield and His Book</h2><p>This powerful and fully documented study exposes the questionable background and faulty theology of the man responsible for the popular Scofield Reference Bible, which did much to promote the dispensational system.

He is a professor at Sweden&#x2019;s National Police Board and is considered the country&#x2019;s foremost expert on crime. He lives in Stockholm.</p><p>1<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Eight weeks earlier, Wednesday, August&nbsp;15. Headquarters of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation on Kungsholmen in Stockholm<br></i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Olof Palme,&#x201d; said the chief of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Lars Martin Johansson. &#x201c;Are you familiar with that name, ladies and gentlemen?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>For some reason he seemed almost joyful as he said it. Just back from vacation with a becoming suntan, red suspenders, and linen shirt with no tie as a lighthearted signal of the transition from relaxation to responsibility. He leaned forward in his seat at the short end of the conference table, letting his gaze wander across the four others gathered around the same table.<br>&nbsp;<br>The joy seemed to be his alone. Doubtful looks were exchanged among three of the four&#x2014;Police Superintendent Anna Holt, Detective Chief Inspector Jan Lewin, and Detective Chief Inspector Lisa Mattei&#x2014;while the fourth in the group, Chief Inspector Yngve Flykt, who was head of the Palme group, seemed if anything embarrassed by the question and tried to compensate by looking politely preoccupied.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Olof Palme,&#x201d; Johansson repeated, his voice now sounding more urgent. &#x201c;Does that ring any bells?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The one who finally answered was Lisa Mattei, the youngest of the group, but long accustomed to the role of best in class. First she glanced at the head of the Palme investigation, who only nodded and looked tired, then she looked down at her notepad, which incidentally was free of any notes or the doodling with which she usually filled it, whatever was being discussed. Then in two sentences she summarized Olof Palme&#x2019;s political career, and in four sentences his end.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Olof Palme,&#x201d; said Mattei. &#x201c;Social Democrat and Sweden&#x2019;s most well-known politician during the postwar period. Prime minister for two terms, from 1969 to 1976 and from 1982 to 1986. Was murdered at the intersection of Sveav�gen and Tunnelgatan in central Stockholm twenty-one years, five months, and fourteen days ago. It was Friday the twenty-eighth of February 1986, twenty minutes past eleven. He was shot from behind with one shot and appears to have died almost immediately. I was eleven years old when it happened, so I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t have much more to contribute,&#x201d; Mattei concluded.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say that,&#x201d; said Johansson with a Norrland drawl. &#x201c;Our victim was the prime minister and a fine fellow, and how common is this kind of crime victim at this sort of place? True, I&#x2019;m only the head of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, but I&#x2019;m also an orderly person and extremely allergic to unsolved cases,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;I take them personally, if you&#x2019;re wondering why you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>No one had wondered about that. No one seemed particularly enthusiastic either. Regardless, the whole thing started as it almost always does, with a few police officers sitting around a table, talking about a case. No flashing lights, no sirens, and definitely no drawn service revolvers. Although when the crime happened, over twenty years ago, it had started with flashing lights, sirens, and drawn service revolvers. Nothing had helped. The case had ended badly.<br>#<br>&nbsp;<br>Johansson elaborated on his ideas about what ought to be done, the motive for doing it, and how it should all be arranged in practical terms. As so often before, he also relied on his personal experience without the slightest trace of either genuine or false modesty.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In my personal experience, when a case has come to a standstill so to speak, it&#x2019;s often worth calling in some new folks who can look at the case with fresh eyes. It&#x2019;s easy to overlook things,&#x201d; said Johansson.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I hear you,&#x201d; Anna Holt answered, sounding more sarcastic than she intended. &#x201c;But if you&#x2019;ll excuse&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Johansson interrupted. &#x201c;Just let me finish my sentence first.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m listening,&#x201d; said Holt. I never learn, she thought.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;re starting to get up in years like me, unfortunately the risk increases that you don&#x2019;t remember what you meant to say, if you get interrupted, that is,&#x201d; Johansson explained. &#x201c;Where was I now?&#x201d; he continued.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How you intended to organize the whole thing, boss,&#x201d; Mattei interjected. &#x201c;Our investigation, that is,&#x201d; she clarified.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Thanks, Lisa,&#x201d; said Johansson. &#x201c;Thanks for helping an old man.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>How does he do it? thought Holt. Even with Lisa of all people?<br>#<br>&nbsp;<br>According to Johansson it was not a question of forming a new Palme investigation, and the investigators who were already in the Palme group&#x2014;several of whom had spent almost their entire active time as detectives there&#x2014;would of course retain sole responsibility.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So I want to make that clear from the start, Yngve,&#x201d; said Johansson, nodding at the head of the Palme group, who still seemed more worried than relieved.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; said Johansson. &#x201c;You can forget any such ideas. I&#x2019;ve imagined something a lot simpler and more informal. What I want simply is a second opinion. Not a new investigation. Just a second opinion from a few wise officers who can look at the case with fresh eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I want you to go through the investigation,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;Is there anything we haven&#x2019;t done that we should have done? Is there anything in the material itself that we&#x2019;ve missed and that&#x2019;s worth looking into? That can still be looked into? If so, I want to know about it, and it&#x2019;s no more difficult than that.&#x201d;<br>#<br>&nbsp;<br>Regardless of his hopes on the last point, the following hour was devoted to discussing objections from three of the four others in the room. The only one who didn&#x2019;t say anything was Lisa Mattei, but when their meeting was over, her notepad was as full of scribbling as always. Partly with what her colleagues had said. Partly with her usual doodling regardless of what was being said.<br>&nbsp;<br>First up was Chief Inspector Jan Lewin, who after some introductory, cautious throat clearing quickly zeroed in on Johansson&#x2019;s fundamental motive, namely the need for fresh eyes. The idea as such was excellent. He himself had advocated it often enough. Not least during his time as head of the group that dealt with so-called cold cases. But for that very reason he thought he was particularly poorly suited for this case.<br>&nbsp;<br>During the initial year of the investigation&#x2014;while Lewin was working at the homicide squad in Stockholm&#x2014;he had primary responsibility for the collection of significant portions of the material evidence. Not until the investigation was taken over by the national bureau did he return to his old assignment at the homicide squad in Stockholm. Several years later he moved over to the national bureau, and once there he had also helped on the Palme investigation for a few brief periods with the registration and review of new leads that had come in.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you remember, boss, but the investigation leader, Hans Holm�r, the police chief in Stockholm at that time, collected large quantities of information that perhaps didn&#x2019;t have anything directly to do with the murder itself but might prove to be of value.&#x201d; Lewin nodded at Lisa Mattei, who had been only a little girl in those days.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I remember the police chief at that time,&#x201d; said Johansson. Of unblessed memory, he thought. &#x201c;Though most of what he found I&#x2019;ve managed to repress. What was it that landed on your desk, Lewin?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>At best, quite a bit of questionable value, according to Lewin.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;All hotel registrations in the Stockholm area around the time of the murder. All arrivals into and departures from the country that could be substantiated with the usual passport and border checks, all parking violations in greater Stockholm around the time of the crime, all speeding violations and other traffic offenses in the whole country the day of the murder, the day before and the day after, all other crimes and arrests in the Stockholm area at the time of the crime. We took in everything from drunkenness and domestic disturbances to all ordinary crimes reported during the twenty-four-hour period in question. We also collected accident reports. Plus all suicides and strange causes of death that happened both before and after the murder. I know when I left the investigation they were still working on that part. As you know, it added up to quite a bit. Hundreds of pounds of paper, thousands of pages actually, and I&#x2019;m only talking about what came in during my time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The broad, unbiased effort,&#x201d; Johansson observed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s called,&#x201d; said Lewin. &#x201c;Sometimes it works, but this time almost all of it remained unprocessed. There simply wasn&#x2019;t time to do anything. I sat and skimmed through what came in, and I had my hands full just with what first jumped out at me. Ninety percent of the paperwork was basically put right back in the boxes where it had been from the start.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Give me some examples,&#x201d; said Johansson. &#x201c;What things jumped out at you, Lewin?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I remember four different suicides,&#x201d; said Lewin. &#x201c;The first took place only a few hours after the murder of the prime minister. I remember it in detail, because when I got the papers on my desk I actually felt some of those old vibrations you feel when things are starting to heat up.&#x201d; Lewin shook his head thoughtfully.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The man who committed suicide had hung himself in the rec room of his house. A guard who took early retirement who lived on Eker� a few miles outside Stockholm. He was the neighbor of a police officer, so I got the tip through him. He also had a license for a handgun, to top it off a revolver that might very well have matched what we knew about the murder weapon at that time. He was generally considered strange by those who knew him. Antisocial, divorced for several years, problems with alcohol, the usual stuff. In brief, he seemed pretty good, but he had an alibi for the evening of the murder. For one thing, he&#x2019;d quarreled with some neighbors who were out with their dog at about ten o&#x2019;clock. Then he called his ex-wife from his home phone, a total of three times if I remember correctly, and carried on with her about the same time as Palme was shot. I had no problem ruling him out. We found his revolver in the house search. It was test fired, even though we already knew it was the wrong caliber.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And the others?&#x201d; Johansson was looking almost greedily at his colleague.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Lewin, &#x201c;at the risk of disappointing you, and I was pretty careful about these cases. I remember when the media started making a row about the so-called police track, that it was some of our fellow officers who murdered Palme, I went into the material on my own and checked for that specifically&#x2014;all the parking violations and other traffic offenses where the vehicle or the perpetrator could be connected to our colleagues, whether or not they were on duty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But that didn&#x2019;t produce anything either,&#x201d; said Johansson.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Lewin. &#x201c;Other than some pretty imaginative explanations of why a particular officer shouldn&#x2019;t have to pay his parking tickets or why his car ended up in such a strange place.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Johansson. &#x201c;The same old women problems if you ask me. Nevertheless, wouldn&#x2019;t it be interesting for you to take another look at your old boxes? Now when you&#x2019;ve got some perspective, I mean. I can&#x2019;t help sensing that you don&#x2019;t seem completely uncomfortable with the job. And you could take a look at all the rest, once you&#x2019;re at it anyway, I mean.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;With some reservations about fresh eyes,&#x201d; said Lewin, sounding more positive than he intended. &#x201c;Well, maybe so. The basic idea is good enough.&#x201d;<br>#</p></p><h2>Power Evangelism (Hodder Christian Paperbacks)</h2><p>This book describes the releasing of God&#39;s power through signs and wonders to refresh, renew, heal, and equip his people.

Grace Schulman is the recipient of the Aiken Taylor Award for Modern Poetry and author, most recently, of <i>Days of Wonder: New and Selected Poems</i> (2002). She is Distinguished Professor of English at City University of New York, poetry editor of <i>The Nation</i>, and former director of the 92nd Street Y Poetry Center.<p> "Her eyes are different from ours, instead of a flashing whole, her mind sees first and they obey its orders in microscopic detail." So wrote Winifred Bryher about her friend Marianne Moore in the 1920s. Anyone reading Grace Schulman's new edition of Moore's poems would do well to keep this comment handy. For the poetry is so full of "eye" that it almost seems to be a visual art.</p><p> Moore's originality has been examined at length quite cunningly by poet-critics ranging from T.S. Eliot to Robert Pinsky. Still, her poems tend to elude those critics whose eyes and minds cannot keep up with the multiple exposures of Moore's oncoming visual details. To reread her now, 31 years after her death at 85, is to wonder how much further an eye could possibly go. Not much, I'd say. So for now, let our eye look at hers. </p><p> Looking backward, then, align your mindful eye with the image Moore conjures in "The Sycamore": "Against a gun-metal sky/ I saw an albino giraffe." Consider, in "Sea Unicorns and Land Unicorns," one of those fabled creatures "etched like an equine monster of an old celestial map." Squint at "An Octopus," "its claw cut by the avalanche." Study her pangolin, with his "sting-proof scales; and nest/ of rocks closed with earth from inside, which he can thus darken." Or watch her herd of elephants: "a/ religious procession without any priests,/ the centuries-old carefullest unrehearsed/ play." And do not neglect the snake of which Moore writes, in her poem "Snakes, Mongooses, Snake-Charmers, and the Like": "one is compelled to look at it as at the shadows of the Alps/ imprisoning in their folds like flies in amber the rhythms of the skating-rink." Here one metaphor foments another with an excitingly exact series of persuasive mixed metaphors.</p><p>Not for nothing did Moore choose to adorn a work with the wistful title "I May, I Might, I Must." For a slow and scrupled writer such as she was, any poem represented a continent of choices. Her fellow poet William Carlos Williams explained the nature of the challenge, and her response: "With Miss Moore a word is a word most when it is separated out by silence, treated with acid to remove the smudges, washed, dried and placed right side up on a clean surface. Now one may say that this is a word. Now it may be used, and how?"</p><p> Moore was known to confess that she had first hoped to be a visual artist. As a Bryn Mawr College senior, she seriously considered attending the Lyme School of Art in Connecticut following her graduation. Many years later, composing some of her best poems in Brooklyn, she wrote and revised, revised and wrote, while sunning herself on the roof of her apartment building. Light, sight, insight, writing: for her all were essentially conjoined. "Yes, light is speech," wrote Moore in a poem. "Free frank/ impartial sunlight, moonlight,/ starlight, lighthouse light,/ are language." She preferred to perceive and penetrate a surface, yet not relinquish it. Tension then ensued between depth and surface, yielding the insight. (Or as Moore, also a revelatory essayist, succinctly pronounced it: "Form is synonymous with content.")</p><p> Holding a fine balance between description and analysis, Moore's poems enchant the reader while reflecting her own enchantment with language. As Morton Dauwen Zabel, her editor at Poetry magazine, noticed, her "sincere and ruthless insight" made her able and willing to "combine the functions of critic and poet in one performance." Schulman's edition of Moore's poetry is needed for a fair appreciation of that performance, for the poet's own fastidiousness led to an unusual publication history: She chose to exclude some of her poems from various collections, imposed drastically revised versions of certain poems on certain volumes, and accepted or mandated orderings of poems within their books that at times made it difficult even for seasoned readers to assess her chronological development. Schulman's edition readjusts Moore's body of work respectfully and generously by restoring lost or overlooked poems in logical sequence, and by lifting the veil on their sundry revised versions.</p><p>How many of Moore's poems do we now have? Her Collected Poems (1981) consists of 130. The Poems of Marianne Moore offers 263, so Schulman introduces readers to more than a hundred poems previously unpublished or uncollected in book form. Moore wrote the bulk of them between the ages of 20 and 26, before she moved to New York City and swiftly became known to an inner circle of poets, editors and poetry critics. Three-fifths of these restored poems have not been previously published anywhere, making this collection a work of excavation and rescue.</p><p> One fruit of the excavation: A reader is able to realize the remarkable feat of Moore's emergence from authoring epigrammatic verse to, you might say, inventing a poetry of epic wants and tendencies. An epigram compresses adroitly a mass of knowledge, thanks to the writer's unquenchable wit; Moore later wrote on a much larger scale without abandoning the epigrammatic yen for unmatched precision, for what she called "exact perception." In this she reigned peerless, even after achieving ultimately in poetry her more complex goal of building a "chain of interactingly/ linked harmony." Time after time, the early poems gathered by Schulman show a writer pausing before making that leap. (Compare "Things Are What They Seem" with "Piningly," an early rehearsal of her flight to come, or with "Old Tiger," where she fulfills her promise. Also, in the early poems one can find precociously pure statements of poetic or moral belief, as in her lines "One associates the love of beauty/ with a wish to see it exemplified." Although she wrote the sentence well before she had obeyed fully its implied guidance, Moore was ever a writer of exempla, as Schulman demonstrates: Although in her poems Moore sought to think, she did it with and through details that carry a moral significance. To read her very early four-line poem "A Fish" alongside her subsequent 40-line poem "The Fish" is to see this plainly and magnificently. The poems flicker, steadfastly visual, throughout these pages. They are, as she demanded of art in "When I Buy Pictures," "lit with piercing glances into the life of things." </p><p> Even now, a novel and a memoir by Moore both remain unpublished, and her 10-year labor of translation, the complete Fables of La Fontaine, seems to have gone out of print -- all sad omissions of publishers, or maybe just bad luck.</p><p> Still, at last we have all of her poems, at least. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Molly McQuade</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

It was a time of creativity unparalleled in history before or since, from science to the arts, from philosophy to politics. Acclaimed philosopher and historian A.C. Grayling points to three primary factors that led to the rise of vernacular (popular) languages in philosophy, theology, science, and literature; the rise of the individual as a general and not merely an aristocratic type; and the invention and application of instruments and measurement in the study of the natural world.</p><p>Grayling vividly reconstructs this unprecedented era and breathes new life into the major figures of the seventeenth century intelligentsia who span literature, music, science, art, and philosophy--Shakespeare, Monteverdi, Galileo, Rembrandt, Locke, Newton, Descartes, Vermeer, Hobbes, Milton, and Cervantes, among many more. During this century, a fundamentally new way of perceiving the world emerged as reason rose to prominence over tradition, and the rights of the individual took center stage in philosophy and politics, a paradigmatic shift that would define Western thought for centuries to come.</p></p><p><b>A.C. Grayling</b> is professor of philosophy at and Master of the New College of the Humanities, London.

Brenda could not have dropped Ruthie if she wanted to.<br><br>"Her full name," Kris provided, "is Ruth Maria Brenda Anne."<br><br>"Hi there, my little Brenda," Brenda said.<br><br>Great-grampa Trouble, trouble to his enemies, trouble to his superiors, and just flat trouble to everyone, including himself, stood well out of range of any spit-up with Billy Longknife, Man of the People, Prime Minister of Wardhaven, and Kris's occasional father.<br><br>"What's her last name?" Grampa Ray asked, coming to stand by his longtime friend, General Trouble, ret.<br><br>"Haven't decided," Kris said. "Probably we'll have to do it before she starts school, but we can wait."<br><br>"You're married to Jack, here," the King said, no part question at all.<br><br>Lieutenant General Jack Montoya nodded, as did Kris.<br><br>"When did that happen?" was as gruff as a man could manage under Ruthie's gummy grin.<br><br>"While I was out of any chain of command," Kris said. "Just before you issued orders making me God Almighty in the Alwa system."<br><br>That got a snort from Ray and a chuckle from everyone else paying attention.<br><br>"I'll bet you any amount of money Rita was at the bottom of this," the King growled.<br><br>"She officiated," Kris said, beaming happily.<br><br>"That woman keeps everyone wrapped around her little finger," Ray muttered.<br><br>Kris considered how much Great-grandfather Ray had pulled the strings that damn near wrapped her in a spiderweb of conflicting duties on Alwa but said nothing. Ray was what he was, and there was little she could do to change him at his present age, with 120-plus years disappearing in the rearview mirror.<br><br>Grampa Trouble laid a nearly affectionate hand on Ray's shoulder. "Ray, you knew those two were going to tie the knot, it was only a question of when and where."<br><br>Kris let out a sigh. This was going smoother than she had expected.<br><br>The Wasp had jumped into the Wardhaven system, finally slowed down enough to hit it at under fifty thousand kilometers an hour. Kris had expected an immediate message from Mac or Ray. After all, they were the ones who had had Grand Admiral Sandy Santiago relieve her of her command and order her home "soonest."<br><br>No message.<br><br>The Wasp docked at High Wardhaven Station as smoothly as if Captain Drago were still at the conn. Kris had expected a message as soon as they opened their locks and plugged into the station's landline, air, water, and sewer.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Jack had to order up transport for Kris and a two-squad Marine Honor Guard-fully locked and loaded. A chief bosun's mate, a fatherly type, had followed along, a diaper bag slung over his shoulder with such aplomb that none would dare gainsay him.<br><br>Only when they had dropped down to the main beanstalk terminal in Wardhaven had the necessary transport been waiting for them. They'd been whisked from the terminal to Main Navy and led by a very silent lieutenant colonel to Mac's inner sanctum.<br><br>The colonel had passed them to Mac's secretary, who smiled, and said, "You are expected," and held open the door to Mac's inner office.<br><br>Kris had taken a deep breath and reported in.<br><br>She still had no idea where the fire was that required her to leave the fleet she had built up, the people she had sworn to protect, and the industrial base she'd grown and overseen.<br><br>I've had enough of being the visiting fireman. Especially enough of being ordered from pillar to post with no idea of what I'm supposed to do or how to do it.<br><br>Still, Kris held her tongue as Ruthie smiled and did her best to wrap around her tiny finger all of Kris's problem people, the Troubles excepted . . . sometimes.<br><br>Even Ray finally tried his hand at holding Ruthie. That was when disaster struck.<br><br>Ruthie scrunched up her face and let out a yowl. Then she spat up.<br><br>Good girl. I've wanted to do that so many times, Kris thought.<br><br>But "diaper bag" was what Kris called for. The Marines and the chief had been able to avoid Kris's little family reunion. Lucky them. These were usually a disaster, and there was no need for the Marines to know just how bad it got the higher up you went. Smart Jack, he'd grabbed the bag, not considering it beneath a three-star to pack the necessities for his tiny daughter. Now he handed the bag to Kris, already opened and with a cleaning cloth, half-pulled out. Kris flashed Jack a smile; whether they were fighting off bug-eyed monsters or close family, she could always count on him.<br><br>Kris traded the cloth to Grampa Ray for Ruthie. Jack had another cloth in hand, so Kris could clean up the tiny one. It was clear, however, that Ruthie had had enough of being nice for family. She still hadn't quite figured out what her lungs were for, but she already knew how to make with her own little war cry.<br><br>"How long's it been since she was fed?" Gramma Ruth asked.<br><br>"Just before we headed down," Kris answered as she checked to see that the diaper was neither wet nor messy. "I think this is an 'I'm hungry, where's lunch' howler," Kris agreed, only too happy to use Ruth for an excuse to get a break from all this family attention.<br><br>"Can I feed her?" Brenda asked eagerly. "Do you have a bottle?"<br><br>"We were not prepared for children on Alwa Station," Kris explained. "We've had to do everything the old-fashioned way."<br><br>"Body birth and breast nursing, huh?" Gramma Trouble provided when Brenda frowned blankly.<br><br>"Yep," Kris said. "Do you have a room where I could nurse Ruthie?"<br><br>"How did you come to have a baby on the front line?" Grampa Ray asked, with a lot of royal command behind it.<br><br>Kris had been waiting for that one. "Someone sabotaged my new birth-control implants, figuring that a pregger admiral couldn't command. I dumped his ass in the bird-guano mines and commanded very well, thank you. By the way, thanks for those beam ships. We would have been toast when six alien hordes hit us all at the same time. With them, they were toast, slathered with marmalade. We did get the first two on our own, thank you very much. Anyway, Ruthie and I need to commune with motherhood just now. Jack can explain more if you need it. Where do we go?"<br><br>Ruthie emphasized the urgency of Kris's request with a bawl that was only three on the baby Richter scale but threatened to go higher if not appeased.<br><br>"Erwin," Mac commanded urgently on his intercom. The secretary appeared at the door. "Show the admiral to Admiral Ballo's office. He's taken leave today."<br><br>Erwin led Kris out of the office, into the hall, and to the next door down. It opened to a very standard set of senior flag officer's spaces. The walls were a deep mahogany. The outer wall had large picture windows with drapes that could be pulled shut. There were a desk, a meeting table, and a discussion pit, all standard-issue. The large armchair in the discussion pit was the one thing out of military step. It was a rocker.<br><br>"Admiral Ballo has a bad back," Erwin explained.<br><br>"He's not in today?"<br><br>Erwin glanced at the wall that the admiral shared with Mac's office. "He didn't say so, but I think he wanted to stay out of range of the collateral damage."<br><br>"Smart man," Kris said, and began to loosen the coat of her dress blues.<br><br>Erwin got the message and left.<br><br>"So it's just you and me, babe," Kris said, and settled Ruthie at her right breast, which, to be honest, was starting to ache. If Ruthie hadn't called for a chow break, Kris might have had to.<br><br>Kris began to relax as Ruthie suckled hungrily. She had a good view from her seat of blue sky and white clouds. That scene could match hundreds of worlds humanity had settled on.<br><br>Kris chose to let that thought wander on its way and smiled down at the miracle at her breast. "It is just you and me, little one."<br><br>2<br><br>Kris, we're going to stay," had become an all-too-frequent refrain in her last days on Canopus Station.<br><br>"<br><br>Penny had been the first.<br><br>"Kris, would you mind terribly if Masao and I stayed?"<br><br>"No," Kris had said, as cheerfully as she could manage. "Of course not."<br><br>But Penny went on talking, as if an explanation might make it hurt less.<br><br>"Admiral Santiago has offered us both a place on her staff. I'm to head up her intelligence section. She says it will mean captain stripes."<br><br>"How will Masao feel about you outranking him that much?" Kris asked.<br><br>"He won't. Santiago has authorization to create a staff drawing in officers from all the Alliance we have out here on Alwa Station. And she can promote them, too. Masao is overdue for lieutenant commander, and commander as soon as she can find an excuse for it."<br><br>"I wonder why I never got that authority," Kris grouched.<br><br>"I don't know, but it's nice she has it. I've also talked with Taussig. We're going to go in on a farm along that big river in Rooster territory. We've asked for a young colonial couple to go in with us. They'll cover the place all the time, and we'll rotate being home."<br><br>Penny paused. "Home. Strange to call this place all the way across the galaxy home."<br><br>"If it's where your and Masao's roots are, then it's home," Kris had said.<br><br>"I've got to get past losing Tommy," Penny said, suddenly. She still choked when she said the name of her husband of three days, who gave his life so that she might live.<br><br>"Yes, you do," Kris said, softly. She suppressed a shiver at the memory of ordering the dumb metal of her ship to seal all the holes in its hull . . . and seal Tommy's fate.<br><br>"I know, Kris. I will. Masao is the man I want to do it with."<br><br>Their conversation meandered along for a while longer before Penny finally left, leaving Kris to contemplate the changes that life brought your way.<br><br>Captain, no, Vice Admiral Drago was next.<br><br>"Commander Pett do okay by you?" he asked Kris after he had smiled at Ruthie Anne and assured Kris that she was a perfect baby.<br><br>"I'm alive, and the Wasp isn't even in line for the body and fender shop."<br><br>"Any landing you can walk away from."<br><br>"So, what really brings you around?" Kris had finally asked.<br><br>"Do you trust Commander Pett to get you and this cute little one back across the galaxy without a problem?"<br><br>"I do. Why?"<br><br>"I'm thinking of hanging around here for a while."<br><br>"Lots of people are," Kris allowed.<br><br>"I mean, it's not like admirals around here spend all their time trapped behind a desk. Everybody fights from four stars down to an Ostrich seaman recruit."<br><br>"It seems to go that way," Kris said, and paused to see if there was more to his hankering.<br><br>"And there's this colonial woman. She's buried two husbands and claims she can put me in the ground. I told her my wedding gift to her will be her very own burial plot," Drago said, grinning.<br><br>"Whatever floats your boat," Kris answered.<br><br>They talked for a bit longer, Kris praising Drago's handling of Fourth Fleet in the last battle. They left with promises to get together when next they shared the same space and share a beer and bring each other up to date.<br><br>There must have been something wrong with the air-recycling system; Kris needed a tissue to blow her nose.<br><br>Amanda and Jacques were no surprise.<br><br>They dropped by to gush to Kris that Prime Minister Ada of the colonials had set up a Science Advisory Committee and invited both of them to fill slots on it.<br><br>"We'll have an entire budding economy to work on," Amanda said.<br><br>"She's in hog heaven," Jacques growled.<br><br>"And you aren't?" Amanda growled right back. "You've got all kinds of bird cultures to work with, and I've heard you say the humans have many divergent cultures among themselves, what with the colonials and the Navy and the industrial types."<br><br>"Oink, oink," Jacques said through a happy grin.<br><br>"And we've also been asked to establish Alwa's first university," said Amanda, getting even more enthusiastic. "They haven't agreed on a name. Rita U just doesn't carry, and she's had so many other last names."<br><br>&#x201c;Rita suggested we name it after her father, Nuu U,&#x201d; Jacques put in.</p><h2>Innocent Victim</h2><p>"1976 was our country's bi-centennial and also a turning point in my life.

Spanning 25 years of Murakami&#39;s career (the oldest story was originally written in 1980, while several were penned in 2005), the stories in BWSW show off Murakami&#39;s amazing skill and versatility. Murakami&#39;s stories are often described as defying typical genre classifications, and while this is true, it would be a mistake to interpret this as meaning that all Murakami stories are the same. The stories in BWSW will alternately leave you scared, laughing, amazed, and confounded. Although everyone will have their favorite stories, my personal favorites were Firefly (later expanded into Norwegian Wood), Hanalei Bay, Tony Takitani, and The Mirror.

Kennedy&#39;s presidency offers insights into the Bay of Pigs crisis, the civil rights battles, his commitment toward Vietnam, and other key events. By the author of American Journey. 75,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p><b>Richard Reeves</b> is the author of presidential bestsellers, including <i>President Nixon</i> and <i>President Kennedy</i>, acclaimed as the best nonfiction book of the year by <i>Time</i> magazine. A syndicated columnist and winner of the American Political Science Association's Carey McWilliams Award, he lives in New York and Los Angeles.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>January 19, 1961<br><br>In the weeks between his election and inauguration as the thirty-fifth President of the United States, John F. Kennedy spent as much time as he could relaxing in the sun at his father's house in Palm Beach, Florida. On the first Saturday night of December, at a casual dinner in the big kitchen with a few friends and members of his campaign staff, someone asked him whether he was nervous about his first meeting with President Dwight Eisenhower, the next Tuesday. Kennedy jumped up laughing. "Good morning, Mr. K-e-e-nnedy," he said, imitating Eisenhower, who sometimes mispronounced his name. Then he swept an imaginary hat from his head, bowed, and said: "Good morning, Mr. Eeeee-senhower."<br><br>Three days later, the forty-three-year-old President-elect, the youngest ever elected, was driven to the North Portico entrance of the White House to meet the seventy-one-year-old President, the oldest man ever elected. Kennedy opened the door of his limousine before it had even stopped and bounded up the six stairs alone, carrying his hat. He caught Eisenhower by surprise. The President, attended by a covey of aides, whipped off his own hat and started to reach out his hand, but Kennedy beat him to the handshake, too. "Good morning, Mr. President," he said.<br><br>"Senator," Eisenhower replied. The Marine Band struck up "The Stars and Stripes Forever."<br><br>It was the first formal encounter between two men of surpassing charm from different generations. The cameras clicking furiously were focused on the two most famous smiles in the land. The general who had commanded all of the Allied troops in Europe during World War II was born in the nineteenth century. At Kennedy's age, he was a major in the Army. His famous grin and calm public manner had convinced many of his countrymen that he was a nice guy and a lousy politician. Those who knew him well thought the opposite. Kennedy lived along a line where charm became power. Men and women fell in love with him. And politics, the career he had chosen, was a business that magnified charm and institutionalized seduction.<br><br>Kennedy and Eisenhower had a certain contempt for each other. Kennedy's campaign attacks had been muted and indirect because of Ike's popularity, but Eisenhower still took them personally. Privately, Kennedy called Ike "that old asshole," the wisecracking Navy officer mocking the commander. Eisenhower, using words of his generation, had called Kennedy "that young whippersnapper" or "Little Boy Blue."<br><br>The two men had met for the first time fifteen years earlier in Potsdam, Germany, at the end of World War II, but General Eisenhower did not remember being approached by an ex-lieutenant, junior grade, who was working as a special correspondent for the Hearst newspapers. And Senator Kennedy's status in Washington before the 1960 election might be measured by the fact that he had never met with the President in eight years in the Senate.<br><br>Their meeting on December 6 was officially unofficial. No notes were taken and no aides sat in. The senator looked at the President's bare desk as they sat down and asked him where he put his papers. Halfway through the question, he realized there were no papers. Eisenhower did not work that way. He did not like details and he preferred talking to reading.<br><br>They talked for more than an hour, mostly about national security and foreign affairs. Eisenhower realized quickly what was on Kennedy's mind and he didn't much like it. His questions were about the structure of decision making on national security and defense. It was clear to Ike that Kennedy thought his structure was too bureaucratic and slow-with too many debates and decisions outside the President's reach and control. Eisenhower thought Kennedy was naive, but he was not about to say that, and so he began a long explanation of how and why he had built up what amounted to a military staff apparatus to collect and feed information methodically to the Commander-in-Chief and then coordinate and implement his decisions.<br><br>"No easy matters will ever come to you as President. If they are easy, they will be settled at a lower level," Eisenhower told him. It was not an idea that appealed to Kennedy. He wanted to see it all.<br><br>"I did urge him to avoid any reorganization until he himself could become well acquainted with the problem," Eisenhower dictated to his secretary later. But clearly Kennedy was not interested in organization charts, or in organization itself, for that matter. Ike's bent toward order was exactly the kind of passive thinking he wanted to sweep away. He had no use for process, with its notemaking, minute taking, little boxes on charts showing the Planning Board and the Operations Coordinating Board. He did not think of himself as being on top of a chart; rather, he wanted to be in the center, the center of all the action.<br><br>The other matter the President wanted to discuss was "burden-sharing." Alone and in a shorter session with Cabinet members that followed, Eisenhower told his successor that it was time to start bringing the troops home from Europe. "America is carrying far more than her share of free world defense," he said. It was time for the other nations of NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) to take on more of the costs of their own defense. Their economies were more productive than ever in their histories and the costs of American deployment were creating a trade imbalance, draining gold from the United States Treasury. Americans, in uniform and out, were spending and buying more overseas than foreigners were spending here. Kennedy nodded. Eisenhower sounded just like his father, who had always drummed into him that nations are only as strong as their currencies.<br><br>At the end of the day, the two men had impressed each other in a grudging sort of way without really agreeing on much. Kennedy was surprised to find Eisenhower so knowledgeable, but that confirmed his conviction that Eisenhower's problem was that he had not understood the real powers of the office. Ike, too, found Kennedy surprisingly well informed about many things, but being President was not one of them.<br><br>Kennedy told his brother Robert, who had waited in the limousine, that he knew now how Ike had become President; there was a surprising force to the man. Eisenhower wrote almost the same words about Kennedy in his diary that night, though he worried that he did not begin to understand the complexity of the job. It seemed to him that Kennedy thought the presidency was about getting the right people in a few jobs here and there.<br><br>He got it. Kennedy believed that problem solving meant getting the right man into the right place at the right time. If things went wrong, you put in someone else. His man for the transition from candidate to President was his personal lawyer, Clark Clifford, who had served on President Truman's staff. In August, three months before the election, Kennedy had said to him, "I don't want to wake up on November 9 and have to ask myself 'What in the world do I do now?'"<br><br>But he did wake up as President-elect asking that question, surrounded by transition memos -- literally surrounded, because he liked to work in bed -- from Clifford, from college professors, from national security intellectuals and high-minded social reformers, from management consultants. Most of it was a waste of time: lists of three hundred appointments that could be delayed until after the inauguration were not worth much to a politician whose first priority was to begin a new campaign to win over some of the 34 million people who voted against him.<br><br>Kennedy had celebrated victory in his house at Hyannis Port with a joke about his wife and Toni Bradlee, the wife of a friend, Ben Bradlee, the Washington bureau chief of <i>Newsweek</i> magazine. Both women were pregnant. "Okay, girls, you can take out the pillows now. We won!" But he looked tired and subdued when he met with four hundred reporters in a National Guard Armory near Hyannis Port. "The New Frontier" the candidate had proclaimed during the campaign was approached rather timidly that morning. He announced that his first telephone calls as President-elect had been to the crustiest dons of Washington's old frontiers: J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, and Allen Dulles, director of the CIA. He had asked them both to stay on.<br><br>Then he had to lie. When a reporter asked about rumors that he had Addison's disease, an adrenal gland failure often considered terminal, Kennedy replied without hesitation, "I never had Addison's disease. In regard to my health, it was fully explained in a press statement in the middle of July, and my health is excellent." The campaign statement was not true. Kennedy had received the last rites of the Catholic Church at least four times as an adult. He was something of a medical marvel, kept alive by complicated daily combinations of pills and injections.<br><br>The necessity to project an image of tirelessness during the campaign was a tremendous physical strain on Kennedy -- and a personal triumph. But he was a wreck when it was over. Sometimes he was barely coherent in the month after the election. He spent most of November and December at the Palm Beach house his father had bought for $100,000 in 1933. There, and later at his house on N Street in Georgetown, he began to put together a government, beginning with Clifford's simple memos, which read like high school texts and were basically lists from McKinsey and Company, the management consultants who had done an almost identical transition study for Eisenhower in 1952. "The occupants of 71 to 74 positions in the Executive Branch and agencies will vitally influence the President-elect's power to govern," one began. "The most important posts are State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, and the UN."<br><br>Kennedy interviewed strangers for hours every day -- falling asleep during an interview with a candidate for Secretary of Agriculture-trying to decide whether to give them some of the most powerful jobs in the world. "We can learn our jobs together," he told one, Robert McNamara, who was president of the Ford Motor Company, when McNamara told him he didn't know anything about government. "I don't know how to be president, either."<br><br>He had read about McNamara, who was a Republican, in Time magazine on December 2 and met him six days later. McNamara asked the first question: "Did you really write <i>Profiles in Courage</i> yourself?" Kennedy insisted he did and then offered McNamara his choice of two of the most important Cabinet seats, Treasury or Defense. McNamara came back a week later saying he preferred Defense, then handed Kennedy a letter detailing his conditions, which included the right of final approval of all appointments in his department.<br><br>Kennedy glanced at the paper, then handed it to Robert Kennedy, sitting beside him on the loveseat. "Looks okay," his brother said.<br><br>"It's a deal," said John Kennedy. He repeated what he had said at their other meeting: "We'll learn together."<br><br>"Jesus Christ, this one wants that, that one wants this," he grumbled as he shuffled notes on the way to play golf in Palm Beach. "Goddamn it, you can't satisfy any of these people. I don't know what I'm going to do about it all."<br><br>His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, who was sitting in the front seat, turned around and said: "Jack, if you don't want the job, you don't have to take it. They're still counting votes up in Cook County."<br><br>By the second week in December, with newspapers needling him about the slow pace of announcements, Kennedy's Georgetown living room looked like a doctor's office, with men shuttling in and out every twenty minutes or so, while reporters and cameras waited outside in the cold.<br><br>He met his Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, who was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, for the first time on the same day he met McNamara. One of Rusk's qualifications was that he was not Adlai Stevenson. "Aren't you going to choose Stevenson?" Rusk had asked him when Kennedy called. "No," Kennedy replied. "Adlai might forget who's the President and who's the Secretary of State."<br><br>He also passed over David K. E. Bruce, a former Ambassador to France and West Germany, because he thought that at sixty-two he was too old. The man he really wanted was Senator William Fulbright of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "It would be nice to have someone in the Cabinet I actually knew," he told Robert Kennedy when Fulbright's name was on the table, or the loveseat. But his brother thought the senator from Arkansas would be unacceptable to black African leaders (and perhaps to American Negroes) because he had signed the Southern Manifesto, an anti-civil rights declaration, in 1957.<br><br>When he came down to Washington for his interview, Rusk didn't know that by process of elimination the big job was almost his already. He was surprised when Kennedy called him the next day with the offer.<br><br>"Wait a minute...," Rusk said. He began telling Kennedy the amount of his mortgage payments and that he had only a few thousand dollars in the bank, saying he could not afford to take a cut from his $60,000 Rockefeller Foundation salary to the $25,000 paid Cabinet members. Kennedy was taken aback. "All right," he replied. "I'm going to Palm Beach tomorrow. You come down." There were a couple of calls to Rockefeller brothers, beginning with Nelson Rockefeller, the governor of New York, and by the time Rusk arrived in Florida, the Rockefeller Foundation had provided a financial package to supplement Rusk's government salary. When Rusk got to the Kennedy mansion, the <i>Washington Post,</i> lying at Kennedy's feet, had a headline saying he would be Secretary of State. It had been leaked by Kennedy himself to Philip Graham, the paper's publisher.<br><br>As Rusk sat there, Kennedy picked up a telephone and called Stevenson to ask him to be Ambassador to the United Nations. Rusk listened, dazzled, as Kennedy worked on Stevenson -- flattering, stroking, prodding. As Kennedy described the job, Rusk thought there would be nothing left for him and the President to do. Finally, Stevenson said yes, he would serve under Rusk.<br><br>Kennedy chose Walter Heller of the University of Minnesota as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers mostly because he was not from Harvard or Yale. There were too many Ivy Leaguers around him already. Heller had met Kennedy in October before he spoke to a Minneapolis rally. The candidate was running an hour late and was changing his shirt when Senator Hubert Humphrey brought Heller in.<br><br>"You're an economist?" Kennedy asked. "Tell me, do you really think we can make this 5 percent growth rate in the platform?"<br>par<br><br>"It'll be pretty tough," said Heller, meaning it would take massive government stimulus. Kennedy asked three more questions: Is accelerated depreciation an effective way to increase investment? Why has the German economy grown so fast in the face of high interest rates? Can a tax cut be an effective stimulus? Heller had never seen anything like it. As soon as Kennedy began talking, the other dozen men in the room stopped, falling away, but still straining to hear what he was saying to the outsider.<br><br>The next time Heller saw Kennedy was in December, in the Georgetown living room. Kennedy nodded toward the dining room where C. Douglas Dillon, Eisenhower's Undersecretary of State, was on the telephone. "I've asked him to be Secretary of the Treasury," Kennedy told Heller. Dillon was calling to get Ike's permission to join the enemy. Eisenhower tried to discourage him, telling him he was being used by liberals who would inevitably undermine sound money principles.<br><br>"I think Dillon will accept and I need you as a counte...</p><h2>Father Fox&#39;s Christmas Rhymes</h2><p>A cozy collection of holiday verse<br><br><i>Who is that knocking at the door?</i><br><i>It&#x2019;s old Father Fox with surprises galore!</i><br><i>Licorice &amp; lollipops, lemons &amp; limes</i><br><i>A bundle of toys &amp; a bag full of rhymes . . .</i><br><br>Over thirty years ago,<i> Father Fox&#x2019;s Pennyrhymes</i> became an instant classic and was a National Book Award Finalist.

It is about the life of a mother trying with other mothers to raise children in a dangerous world. It is also the inspiring story of how she and her neighbors found ways of working with each other, the youngsters, the elderly, the unemployed, the addicts, the drunks, and even the police and the drug dealers--in a courageous effort to preserve their homes and their lives. It teaches community action we can all adopt, such as tutoring at local schools, encouraging teenagers to start a gardening project, and accompanying them to court when they find themselves in trouble. This book illustrates our collective responsibility for bringing about healing. It is a brave and wonderful wake-up call, full of the nitty-gritty of how each of us can make a difference when push really does come to shove. Drawing on deep reserves of good humor, common sense, and practical experience of nonviolent action, Melody Ermachild Chavis has written a moving testament to the power of spirit in today's often cynical world.<br><br>Altars in the Street is for people who live in cities and those who have fled them. It will speak to anyone who cares about the future of our children, our neighborhoods, and our nation, anyone who wants to look truthfully at the relationship between poverty and prisons, and between community and education. It is also for those who seek to put spirituality to work where it really counts--on the street where we live.</p><p>"Ms. Chavis's moving account of her efforts to build, protect, and enhance a home and community are compelling reading for all who are truly committed to efforts to solve community problems and to build a better future for our children."<br>-Congressman Ronald V. Dellums<br><br>"This exhilarating book is must reading for anyone who suspects that there is a link between spiritual awakening and social action. 'Engaged Buddhism' takes on flesh and bones in this fast-paced account that both warms and wrenches the heart.

Was Socrates black? Did Aristotle steal his ideas from the library in Alexandria? Do we owe the underlying tenets of our democratic civilizaiton to the Africans? Mary Lefkowitz explains why politically motivated histories of the ancient world are being written and shows how Afrocentrist claims blatantly contradict the historical evidence. Not Out of Africa is an important book that protects and argues for the necessity of historical truths and standards in cultural education.For this new paperback edition, Mary Lefkowitz has written an epilogue in which she responds to her critics and offers topics for further discussion. She has also added supplementary notes, a bibliography with suggestions for further reading, and a glossary of names.</p><p>Wellesley classics professor Mary Lefkowitz takes aim at the basic claims of leading proponents of Afro-centrism, in this expansion of her New Republic article exposing flaws in the argument that black Africans were responsible for the great civilizations of Egypt and Greece that brought praise from historians and criticism from Afrocentrists. Lefkowitz argues that the Greeks&#39; African heritage touted by Senegalese scholar Cheikh Anta Diop is based upon a single dubious source and that Egyptians never considered themselves black Africans, in fact, that they consciously disassociated themselves from blacks. She argues that the legacy of these two cultures remains so rich even foes of European civilization want to claim that legacy for themselves.Mary Lefkowitz is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Wellesley College.</p><h2>Yarns of Wisconsin</h2><p>D1 Paperback 1978 224p. 8.50x5.50x0.70.

This truth pushes us toward practice, in the hopes that we may awaken our potential and live up to what is inside us.&nbsp;This is a&nbsp;notion taught widely by ninth century Zen Master Lin Chi, and in his tradition Thich Nhat Hanh employs the teachings and writings of Mahayana Buddhism to discuss specific topics in Buddhist study and practice. With these teachings, readers have the tools to awaken the Buddha within.</p><p>Vietnamese Zen Buddhist master Thich Nhat Hanh usually presents teachings simply and often lyrically. This book, a translation and commentary on teachings of the Chinese master Linji, a founder of the Zen tradition, is not so simple and not very lyrical. But there's a good reason. Linji was one of those Zen masters who was given to paradox, shouting at students and employing cryptic behaviors and words. As Nhat Hanh helpfully notes, Reading his words is like taking a very strong medicine. So the contemporary Zen master is, comparatively, a more penetrable guide to his predecessor, as a commentator ought to be. The text calls on Nhat Hanh's scholarly abilities. He is more than a humble monk, and this side of him is much less familiar to his many readers. He is able to encapsulate Linji's philosophy in his characteristically memorable way: the enlightened person has nothing to do, nowhere to go. Also true to form, he offers easy breathing practices based on what Linji says. The book could be better organized; the text and commentaries are in separate chapters, necessitating a lot of flipping back and forth. This book is fresh and stimulating for advanced Zen practitioners. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His last and most adventurous work was almost complete at the time of his death in 2006, and a handful of his gardening friends gladly finished the task.<br> <br> Illustrated with stunning photographs by Jonathan Buckley, <i>Exotic Planting for Adventurous Gardeners</i> both inspires and instructs. Few gardeners will be able to resist Lloyd's call to "do something outlandish, to splash out, and be freer than ever."The late Christopher Lloyd (1921-2006) lived in the 15th century half-timbered manor house of Great Dixter his entire life. He is the author of a string of bestselling garden classics, and in 1979 the Royal Horticultural Society conferred on him its highest award, the Victoria Medal of Honour.&#34;</p><h2>China Mountain Zhang</h2><p>On a twenty-second-century Earth and Mars dominated by global Chinese hegemony, extraordinary individuals struggle to find their places in their cracking world order</p><p>When talking about this book you have to list the awards it's won--the Hugo, the Tiptree, the Lambda, the <i>Locus,</i> a Nebula nomination--after that you can skip the effusive praise from the <i>New York Times</i> and get to the heart of things: This is a book about a future many don't agree with.

If overlooked or ignored, a child's spiritual development quickly fades or disappears entirely.<br><br>Tobin Hart, psychologist, professor, and pioneer of the ChildSpirit movement, explains how to recognize and identify children's deep spiritual connections. Children's spirituality is an important part of the development of identity and self-actualization, and recognizing and nurturing this growth process is critical for parents, educators, and therapists. Based on more than ten years of interviews, this book combines startling firsthand accounts of secret spiritual lives, including recollections from adults who have forgotten or repressed such childhood experiences. Dr. Hart's exploration reveals the astonishing complexity of inner spirituality and exposes children's innate ability to access wisdom and knowledge far beyond their years.<br><br>Nimbly interweaving insights and practical advice into a body of scientific study, The Secret Spiritual World of Children provides an entirely accessible and practical guide for nurturing the heightened spiritual sensitivity in children and reclaiming it as adults.<br></p><p>Adults too often mistakenly believe that to be considered spiritual a child must understand the tenets of a particular religion. In fact, says Hart, children are far more likely to experience what William James referred to as "personal religion" (an intimate knowledge of God) without any formal religious training. After learning that his six-year-old daughter often saw angels, psychologist Hart embarked upon a five-year study of children's spirituality, an area all but ignored in the annals of child psychology. Defining spirituality as an intimate and direct influence of the divine in our lives, Hart interviewed more than 100 children and adults about their experiences. The inspiring accounts he reports reveal that often independently of, and sometimes despite, their parents, children enjoy rich and rewarding relations with the spiritual side of life. He concludes by proposing that parents encourage spirituality in their children by recognizing them as complete spiritual beings, and he offers parents a "spiritual curriculum" intended to nurture a child's personal power and perspective. <i>Donna Chavez</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Lord Merridith and his family board the titular ship in 1847, bound for New York, leaving behind an Ireland devastated by famine and strife. The family's beautiful nanny, Mary Duane, is with them, having fled a life of poverty, prostitution, and extreme tragedy. Another passenger, American journalist Grantley Dixon, is lured to America by business and his thinly veiled affair with Lady Merridith. Mary Duane discovers that Pius Mulvey, her former fianc� and the brother of her deceased husband, is among the overcrowded group of disease-ridden steerage passengers. A renowned thief and murderer, Mulvey abandoned Duane, only to return and sabotage her life in Ireland. Despised by his countrymen, Mulvey has been ordered by a group of steerage thugs to assassinate the demonized Merridith or face his own death. <p> Conflict is inevitable, but O'Connor is more interested in the complexity of history and relationships and how each makes reinvention and resolution impossible. O'Connor presents the story as a work of journalism written by Dixon, composed in the era's tabloid style, even including passages from the captain's register and crew interviews. These devices lend the work a sense of authenticity, reinforced by the author's intimate knowledge of the period and his evocative, realistic prose: "At night one sensed the ship as absurdly out of its element, a creaking, leaking, incompetent concoction of oak and pitch and nails and faith, bobbing on a wilderness of viciously black water which could explode at the slightest provocation." O'Connor conveys a sense of immediacy and dimension in his ambitious story, providing this uncertain voyage with an ultimate sense of direction. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2003, 0-15-100908-2 <br></p><h2>Royal Horticultural Society Propagating Plants (RHS) by Toogood, Alan R.

Refuting those who claim that Bruno Richard Hauptmann was framed, the author presents a convincing case that he was guilty of the kidnap-murder of 20-month-old Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. In this well-documented study Fisher thoroughly covers the case, from the night the baby was taken from his home in Hopewell, N.J., on March 1, 1932, to Hauptmann's execution on April 3, 1936. The author vivifies the people involved: the child's parents; eccentric Dr. Condon who paid the ransom to "Cemetery John"; the competing investigators; the charlatans who offered to ransom the baby for huge sums; etc. Although Fisher notes that the police made mistakes and that Hauptmann's defense was incompetent, he argues that evidence of the accused's guilt is overwhelming.

Written by Charles Leland, it fits in with many of his other works, and covers what he purports as a tradition of folkish witchcraft and fairy lore in central Italy. Indeed, the occult usefulness here is as expansive as the historical, since it contains complete invocations and a series of rituals as part of its scope.</p><p>Charles Godfrey Leland (August 15, 1824 &#x2013; March 20, 1903) was an American humorist and folklorist, born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was educated at Princeton University and in Europe. Leland worked in journalism, travelled extensively, and became interested in folklore and folk linguistics, publishing books and articles on American and European languages and folk traditions. Leland worked in a wide variety of trades, achieved recognition as the author of the comic Hans Breitmann&#x2019;s Ballads, fought in two conflicts, and wrote what was to become a primary source text for Neopaganism half a century later, Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches.</p><h2>Making Faces: Drawing Expressions For Comics And Cartoons</h2><p>Chances are, you already know how to draw some expressions.

Author Marc Scott Zicree spent five years researching and writing what is without a doubt the definitive look at this classic horror-fantasy-science fiction show. (The series originally ran from 1959 to 1965, but is still seen in syndication around the world.) Not only is the book an exhaustive episode-by-episode guide, but the author apparently interviewed every living soul who was ever associated with the show. It's quite likely that creator Rod Serling, who died before the book saw publication in 1982, would have been suitably impressed by the respect and dedication that clearly went into this labor of love. Zicree later revised and expanded <i>The Twilight Zone Companion</i> for a second edition in 1989, and discusses both the briefly revived series and the feature film based on the show. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>The Twilight Zone Companion is the complete show-by-show guide to one of television&#39;s greatest series, including plot synopsis and behind-the-scenes stories from the original artists who created the series. Zicree&#39;s well-written account is fascinating reading for even the casual fan.</p><h2>A Survival Guide to the Portuguese Camino in Galicia: Information about the Portuguese Way in Galicia</h2><p>Revised and updated for 2019. The only Camino guidebook written by a person who works as a guide on the Camino and who gets to walk regularly to Santiago de Compostela. A Survival Guide to the Portuguese Camino in Galicia will not only provide you with simple, concise and to-the-point information about the route you are following, but will also help you understand and appreciate Spanish idiosyncrasy, which is usually the most intriguing, and at times frustrating, part of a trip for travellers. This is also a guidebook that provides insider insight and information about the Camino; information on where you are walking, why you are looking at things and how to make the most of your experience; all that stuff that is not readily available to travellers from abroad. In a nutshell, this is a guidebook written by a Spanish pilgrim for pilgrims from abroad. Please note that this guidebook only covers the last section of the Portuguese Camino, the part that crosses Galicia in Spain. It does NOT cover any of the stages in Portugal.</p><p>Jeffery Barrera has a Five-Year University Degree in Fine Arts by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Madrid, Spain); and more than 10 years experience working as a printmaker in a print workshop (kind of what D�rer did, but in Madrid).

Each aspect of Robert MacNeil's youthful existence prompted yet another linguistic thrill. Childhood churchgoing "did not provide me with any spiritual awakening ... but it anointed me with language." His mother's passion for the natural world and his father's life as a ship's skipper gave him two more complete vocabularies. And "If you define yourself by the language you acquire as you enter different spheres," MacNeil writes, the absurd language of "cricket was another piece of my self-definition." <p> MacNeil is best known as a novelist, coauthor of <i>The Story of English</i>, and onetime executive editor of the <i>MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</i>. In <i>Wordstruck</i> he imparts a passion for Shakespeare (in particular, <i>Hamlet</i>), Dylan Thomas, and T. S. Eliot, whose ear for the English language, he says, was "the equivalent of perfect pitch--for the harmonic range of our tongue, its rhythms, and all its voices." <i>Wordstruck</i> is a charming memoir from a man "crazy about the sound of words, the look of words, the taste of words, the feeling for words on the tongue and in the mind."</p>PBS-TV Newshour presenter MacNeil coauthored the book and TV series The Story of English. Here he tells how, as a child, he began a lifelong fascination with languagethe crisp sea-words of Treasure Island , sonorous Bible phrases, Chaucer's pithiness, Shakespeare's magical syntax and, later, "flashes of recognition" from T. S. Eliot and Dylan Thomas, among others. Growing up during World War II in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where his naval father was based, MacNeil drank in the seacoast atmosphere but more avidly feasted on books. Later, his performances in school plays led to jobs in radio and a full-time broadcasting career, much of it in England, where he took a renewed interest in idioms and dialects. Not quite chronological, the author's account roves fondly back and forth between family memories and his love of words and language. 60,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; Literary Guild alternate; author tour. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Real Tadzio : Thomas Mann&#39;s &#39;Death in Venice&#39; and the Boy Who Inspired It</h2><p>Whilst visiting Venice in 1911 Thomas Mann&#39;s eye was drawn to a young sailor-suited boy of almost supernatural beauty, and was inspired to write Death in Venice.

In this critically acclaimed work Peter Matthiessen explores new terrain on a continent he has written about in two previous books, A Tree Where Man Was Born -- nominated for the National Book Award -- and Sand Rivers.<br><br>Through his eyes we see elephants, white rhinos, gorillas, and other endangered creatures of the wild. We share the drama of the journeys themselves, including a hazardous crossing of the continent in a light plane. And along the way, we learn of the human lives oppressed by bankrupt political regimes and economies, and threatened by the slow ecological catastrophe to which they have only begun to awaken.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>"Deeply gripping... with a prose of characteristic grace and perfectly distilled passion." -- Washington Post Book World<p>"Matthiessen is a great travel companion .....

A horrible murder has occurred in the family of his half-brother, Rabbi Jonathan Levin. The rabbi&#39;s brother-in-law was found slain in a seedy hotel room in upper Manhattan, and the victim&#39;s 15-year-old niece, with whom he was spending the day, is missing. Decker, with Rina at his side, immediately heads out to New York to assist in the investigation. But what starts out as simple inquiries soon evolves into a twisted and perilous journey -- from the darkened slums of New Jersey and the deserted industrial streets of New York to the recesses of sexual perversity and the hidden meeting places of Hasidic outcasts. Thrust into a deadly maze of deceit, lies, and danger, the couple can no longer trust anyone -- friend or family. And when salvation is finally within Decker&#39;s grasp, it can only be delivered by a depraved lone wolf, hell-bent on his own personal vengeance.</p><p>Family business can be deadly, as Peter Decker discovers in Kellerman's latest thriller starring the L.A. police lieutenant and his wife, Rina Lazarus. Decker's half-brother Jonathan, a New York rabbi, asks for help when his wife's brother Ephraim Leiber is slain execution-style in a seedy New York hotel room, and the victim's teenage niece Shayndie, who may have witnessed her uncle's murder, disappears. But it soon becomes apparent that not everyone is as eager for Decker's assistance as Jonathan--not the New York City cops, not the missing girl's parents, and not the police chief in the upstate town of Quinton, where the Liebers live in a tightly knit Orthodox Jewish enclave. Despite these roadblocks, the ever resourceful Decker manages to locate Shayndie in the last place one might expect to find a devout, gently raised 15-year old girl--the heavily guarded Manhattan apartment of Chris Donatti, a Mob-connected criminal with whom Peter has a complicated history. But when Shayndie runs away from Donatti's loft and turns up dead a few days later, Decker's search for her killer uncovers a deadly family secret that puts his life--and Rina's--in jeopardy. As usual in this outstanding series, Kellerman's pacing is flawless, her plotting ingenious, and her deep understanding of human nature reconfirmed. <i>--Jane Adams</i>FAYE KELLERMAN is the author of the bestselling Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus novels, as well as a thriller, Moon Music, and a historical novel, The Quality of Mercy.

This innate power allows you to know the future; freely communicate with God and the angels; and heal yourself, others, and the planet. In Chakra Clearing, Doreen Virtue guides you through meditations and visualizations to clear your chakras, which activates your inborn healing and psychic abilities. Enclosed you&#x2019;ll also find a code for an audio download that complements the material in the book. The audio starts with a morning meditation designed to begin your day with a bright, positive energy frequency and surround you with healing light. The relaxing evening meditation that follows clears away energy that you may have absorbed during the day, and invites angels to enter your dreams and give you divine messages. This comprehensive chakra-clearing program will help you fullyactivate your spiritual power to know and heal!</p><p>For readers who seek a straightforward guidebook on learning about the chakra system and how to keep it healthy, this is an excellent resource. Virtue, who is a bestselling author (<i>Messages From Your Angels</i>, <i>Healing With the Angels</i>) and clairvoyant doctor of psychology, identifies the placements and functions of these "energy centers" in the body. She then teaches readers how to keep these chakras clear and clean, leading to greater health and energy. <p> The chakras themselves are a beautiful progression of shifting colors, starting with the red root chakra at the base of the spine and moving up the body, shade-by-shade, and ending with the royal purple "crown" chakra at the top of the head. Each chakra interacts with a person's issues and concerns in the world. For instance, the root chakra relates to basic survival, such as money, shelter, and material needs, according to Virtue. If a person feels stable in this arena, the "root chakra looks like a brilliant ruby held under a spotlight," she explains. However, if people feel fearful about money or become overly obsessed with their career or possessions, this chakra will be come "dirty" and have a muddy, dark red color. </p><p> Virtue offers an extensive assortment of original, guided meditations that are effective in cleaning and clearing all the chakras. The information is well organized and clearly presented with a corresponding CD to help readers integrate the meditations into daily life. She also touches upon other cleaning tools, such as what foods and crystals support the chakra system. Advanced energy workers may find this material basic, but beginners should find it an outstanding primer. --<i>Gail Hudson</i></p><i>&#x201c;This book and audio will help you understand the functions of the major chakras, </i><br><i>and esoteric methods for clearing them of fear.

Gregg's poems oscillate between hushed reminiscence and savage whispers, always seeming to originate deep within a closely studied self: You walk... with your life inside you. The poems travel the globe, set in New England, California, Mexico, Greece and beyond, though wherever her poems go, Gregg never forgets that if paradise is to be here/ it will have to include her. Gregg offers up poems of love lost and won, and of an average life lived with extraordinary force, as high art, honing in on little tragedies that lead inexorably to the big one, Death, which more often than not arrives personified: When death comes, we take off our clothes. The poems always rejoice, however dark their subjects, in a powerful sense of simply being alive, and at times beauty and happiness break through in moments of stillness and solitude: It is summer and I am in the middle/ of my life. Alone and happy. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tried to focus on Noah&#x2019;s watch. He was still waving it around, so I couldn&#x2019;t see what time zone he had it set for, but I knew it was synchronized to the atomic clock at the Naval Observatory and updated continuously by satellite. When Noah&#x2019;s watch beeped, it wasn&#x2019;t kidding.</p> <p>&nbsp;I smoothed <i>H2O Submerged, Episode Nine: Cataclysm</i> shut. Shot a glance at the back counter. If I was going to do this thing, I had to do it now.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Noah clicked his watch off and swung his bassoon case over his shoulder. Don&#x2019;t ask what a bassoon is. No one knows. I&#x2019;ve been Noah&#x2019;s best friend since kindergarten, and I&#x2019;m still not sure. It looks like . . . actually, it looks like Noah. Some people look like their dogs.

It had been raining all afternoon, and the damp air drew out the shop&#x2019;s wet-dog aroma.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;We reached the counter, where Caveman sat hunkered over a graphic novel, his Hawaiian shirt stretched over the mountains of his shoulders, his wild black hair fluttering as he turned a page. He truly was a caveman. A caveman with a Wonder Woman lunchbox collection.</p> <p>&nbsp;I pushed <i>H2O</i> toward him, reached into my shoe, and pulled out three dollars and twenty-one cents. I clanked it onto the counter. Caveman dinged the cash register open and slid the money in. He didn&#x2019;t even look at it. He knew I had the exact change. He slipped <i>H2O</i> into a plastic sack, handed me the receipt, and went back to his novel.</p> <p>&nbsp;I swallowed. A nervous tang prickled my throat. I&#x2019;d been working up my courage since Noah and I first stepped into Caveman Comics&#x2014;no, before that, before we left school even&#x2014;and if I didn&#x2019;t do it now, I wouldn&#x2019;t get another chance till next month.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Noah gave me an encouraging thumbs-up.</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;So.

You know, so it wouldn&#x2019;t look like I was making a big deal out of it or anything. &#x201c;You ever think about deliveries?&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;Caveman licked a finger. Turned a page. Didn&#x2019;t look up. &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;At least, I think that&#x2019;s what he said. It was more of a grunt than an actual word. Which partially explains his name.</p> <p>&nbsp;I took another breath. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just this idea I had. Deliveries, I mean. Like Pizza Rocket, only with comics instead of, you know, pizza. You should think about it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;Caveman turned another page. &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;Nope, he wouldn&#x2019;t think about it? Or nope, he&#x2019;d already thought about it, decided it was a bad idea, and was never going to think about it again?&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Hard to tell.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I nodded.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;I tucked the receipt in my shoe (a.k.a. the best place to store your most important paperwork), gripped the crinkly plastic stack, and started toward the door.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Because here&#x2019;s what I was thinking,&#x201d; I said. Casually. Like I was tossing ideas at him on my way out. &#x201c;It might do a lot for your business. You know, provide just one more service no other comic book shop provides.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;Not that Caveman was big on service in the first place. But still.</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Dude.&#x201d; Another lick. Another page. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not delivering your comic books. You can come down here and buy them like everybody else.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;I stopped. A whole sentence. Two, actually.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;But see?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the beauty of it. These deliveries&#x2014;they wouldn&#x2019;t be <i>to</i> me. They&#x2019;d be <i>from </i>me. You&#x2019;d hire me to be your comic book delivery man. On my bike.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;With Beecher on the handlebars if I had to.</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Not happening.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;I blinked. &#x201c;Okay. But think about it because&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Not happening.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Okay, but if you change your mind&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Tucker,&#x201d; Noah whispered. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s happening.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;I sighed. When Noah and I rule the world, comic book delivery will be mandatory.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Noah headed for the door. I trudged after him, the crinkly sack rustling against my leg. We wound our way through tables and racks and shelves, all groaning under the weight of the world&#x2019;s greatest superheroes: H2O and Batman, Superman and Spidey. American and Japanese.</p> <p>&nbsp;We passed a small rack squeezed in between NEW RELEASE and GOLDEN AGE CLASSICS. One of Caveman&#x2019;s signs was thumbtacked above it, black marker on a scrap of dusty poster board:&nbsp;&nbsp;LOCAL INDIES</p> <p>&nbsp;Most people came in looking for the latest X-Men and didn&#x2019;t know these were here.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;But I knew.</p> <p>&nbsp;Because these weren&#x2019;t like the other comic books in the store. They weren&#x2019;t written by famous comic book writers and drawn by famous artists. They weren&#x2019;t printed in color on shiny paper and shipped out by the millions every month by Marvel or D.C. or Dark Overlord or some other behemoth comic book company.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Mostly they were black-and-white Xeroxes, carefully folded and stapled, printed a handful at a time, probably at the copy shop over by the university.</p> <p>&nbsp;But they were here. Real live comics in a real live comic book store.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;I pulled one out. Ran my hand over the grainy cover.</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;So, hey. Caveman,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&nbsp;He may have grunted. Or maybe not. The Cavester was a man of few words.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Have these indie comics started making any money?&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&nbsp;And sometimes no words. He didn&#x2019;t even glance up.</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah. I know. Not as much as it costs the artists to print them. But I thought I&#x2019;d ask. Just to see if anything had changed. I guess it hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;I slid the comic back into the rack. Ran my hand over it one more time. One day that would be me. One day my comic books would be for sale. And not just here at Caveman. Across the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Across the country? Heck, around the planet. I&#x2019;d be the most famous comic book artist ever, world-renowned for creating . . . well, I didn&#x2019;t know what. Yet. But he (or she&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t be raised by my mother and not consider the very real possibility that the world&#x2019;s greatest superhero just might be a girl) would be amazing. The most amazing comic book hero ever.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;I&#x2019;d go to all the big comic book conventions, and the line of fans waiting for my autograph would stretch out of the building and around the block. Which would be exciting, but it wouldn&#x2019;t give me a big head. I&#x2019;d still be humble. I&#x2019;d still be Tucker MacBean from Wheaton, Kansas. I&#x2019;d still talk to everyone who came up to me and thank them for the excellent things they said about my&#x2014;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Tucker.&#x201d; Noah tapped his watch.</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with you.&#x201d; I turned away from the indie rack. I&#x2019;d have to be famous later.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Noah and his bassoon leaned into the glass door. The afternoon thunderstorm had fizzled out, but a leftover wind swirled in from the stairwell and spit drizzle at us.</p> <p>&nbsp;I pulled the collar of my jacket up around my ears. Glanced back at Caveman.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I called back to him. &#x201c;See you next month.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;I doubt it.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>&nbsp;I doubt it?</i> What did he mean? I was his most loyal customer. I bought at least one comic book a month. Every single month.</p> <p>&nbsp;I was as dependable as Noah&#x2019;s watch.</p> <p>&nbsp;And I told Caveman so.</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;I always come in. The very day the new <i>H2O</i> hits the stands.&#x201d; Next month especially. The episode I held in my hand, <i>Episode Nine,</i> contained a secret that would rock the H2O universe. <i>Episode Ten</i> would be the epic showdown that changed that universe forever.</p> <p>&nbsp;Caveman licked his finger and turned a page. &#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;That was all he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;I shot a funny look at Noah, who was still standing in the doorway, the wind whipping specks of rain against his glasses.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;What does he mean?&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&nbsp;Noah rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Who ever knows what he means? Let&#x2019;s just go.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s got to mean <i>something</i>.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp; &#x201c;Tucker? Hello?

A radical change occurred with the introduction of new deities, among them the Five Great Kings, the most important of them being Fudo Myo-o, the conqueror of all disasters and evil. This book is a study of the concept, iconography and decoction of Fudo in art. Beginning with a detailed account of the origin of Buddhism and its introduction into Japan, the book focuses on development of esoteric Buddhism in the country. It delves into the uniqueness of Shingon Buddhism rituals which try to evoke the vitality of the three mysteries in the body, speech and thought, the mysteries being transmitted orally from the master to the disciple. Describing Fudo Myo-o as discussed in Buddhist literary sources from India, it takes up his visual representation in painting and sculpture. It discusses the representation of his attendants in art and iconography, symbolic instruments associated with the god in his depiction and interpretations of the mudras (hand gestures, postures, emblems) carried by Fudo. It explains the esoteric meaning attached to various ideas and concepts represented in the visual images. Supported by numerous illustrations, this detailed and thorough study would enthral students and scholars of Buddhist art and iconography.</p><p>Dr Sampa Biswas has done her Ph.D. in Art History from Kala Bhawan, Santiniketan, West Bengal.

Among them, Boy, Snow, and Bird&nbsp; confront the tyranny of the mirror to ask how much power surfaces really hold. </p> <p> Dazzlingly inventive and powerfully moving <i> , Boy, Snow, Bird </i> is an astonishing and&nbsp; enchanting novel. With breathtaking feats of imagination, Helen Oyeyemi confirms&nbsp; her place as one of the most original and dynamic literary voices of our time. </p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, March 2014:</strong> After escaping the cruel wrath of her abusive father, Boy Novak finds comfort in a small Massachusetts suburb and a widower named Arturo, whom she later marries. Boy is quite taken with Arturo's daughter Snow, but it's the daughter she has with Arturo that complicates their quiet lives--Bird's birth reveals that both Arturo and Boy are light-skinned African-Americans passing for white. Harkening back to the great passing narratives, like Charles W. Chesnutt's <em>The Marrow of Tradition</em> and, most notably, <em>Passing</em> by Nella Larsen, <em>Boy, Snow, Bird</em> is about both the exterior and interior complexities of racial identity. The perception of Arturo and Boy's race and social class is threatened by Bird. But it's the psychological conflicts that are the most devastating. Arturo was raised with "the idea that there was no need to ever say, that if you knew who you were then that was enough, that not saying was not the same as lying." Is passing dishonest if it isn't an active decision? <em>Boy, Snow, Bird</em> is a retelling of <em>Snow White</em>, and the wit and lyricism of Helen Oyeyemi's prose shares the qualities of a fable. But this novel isn't content to conclude with an easy moral. In fact, Oyeyemi complicates the themes she establishes. Her writerly charms shouldn't be taken for granted; the beauty of her writing hides something contemplative and vital, waiting to be uncovered by readers. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em></p><b>Helen Oyeyemi&nbsp; </b> is the author of five novels, most recently&nbsp;<i>White Is for Witching</i>, which won a 2010 Somerset Maugham Award, and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Fox</i>, which won a 2012 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award.

"A skydiving collision and rescue in midair; a girl snatched from the jaws of an alligator; a toddler saved after falling down an abandoned well: the three exciting true rescue stories in this title are told with realistic detail and suspense that will make kids read."--<i>Booklist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>Grade 2-3-- Three dramatic stories of rescues--tales that could bring chills to readers. Unfortunately, their impact is lessened by the informal fictionalized presentation of the facts and the use of first names. The only indication that the stories are true is the dateline at the beginning of each of the three episodes. The first rescue involves a skydiver who is knocked unconscious and unable to open her parachute. In the second episode, a boy manages to grab a young girl away from the jaws of an alligator. The last event recounts the amazing rescue of a toddler who fell into a deep well. As beginning-reader fare, the book does fill the bill for readability at the late primary level. However, the present-tense narratives and the lack of specific facts make it less successful as nonfiction. The illustrations are realistic and aid comprehension. Especially well done are the diagrams depicting the child's entrapment in the well and the efforts taken to reach her. --Sharron McElmeel, Cedar Rapids Community Schools, IA<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Enemy in the Fort (American Girl History Mysteries)</h2><p>When a boy raised by the Abenaki Indians--the tribe that captured her family two years ago--comes to stay with her, 12-year-old Rebecca Percy believes that he is responsible for the rash of burglaries that have occurred, but when she tries to prove his guilt, she makes a startling discovery that shatters her beliefs about Indians and settlers. Simultaneous.</p><p>Grade 4-7-Rebecca Percy's parents and baby brother have been kidnapped by the Abenaki Indians on the dangerous 1754 New Hampshire frontier, leaving Rebecca and her sister to seek shelter at Fort Number 4 with kindly Widow Tyler. The work is hard, but Rebecca never gives up hope that her family might have been sold to the French, who often ransomed captives back to the English. She reacts with fear and disgust, however, when the woman takes in Isaac, a white boy who has been raised by the Abenakis and remains loyal to them. Shortly after his arrival, a series of thefts occur among the settlers. Of course, Isaac is the logical suspect. The plot is carefully built with interesting and well-researched historical details. The mystery is also well crafted, and children will enjoy gathering clues and trying to guess the outcome. Characterizations are strong, with believable growth. For example, Rebecca develops empathy for the Abenakis, moving from a hateful attitude toward a greater understanding of their desperate situation. The relationships between the Native people and the settlers are complex, and are responsibly and respectfully presented.<br><i>Lee Bock, Glenbrook Elementary School, Pulaski, WI </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4-7. This entry in the History Mysteries series, set just before the outbreak of the French and Indian War, provides both a glimpse at social history and a powerful message about prejudice. In 1752, 10-year-old Rebecca Percy and her little sister watch from a hiding place as the Abenaki Indians take their parents captive. The horror leaves the sisters with a bone-deep hatred for the Indians--and two engraved spoons from England, which figure in the mystery. The girls are taken to live with the Widow Tyler in Fort Number Four in New Hampshire. Their lives (and the lives of others in the small community) are disrupted again by the arrival of a 14-year-old "white Indian" boy, captured by the Indians when he was small and now totally assimilated into Abenaki culture. When the girls' precious spoons are stolen and Indians raid the fort, the boy is suspected of both thievery and treachery. Rebecca's efforts to search out the truth put her in satisfyingly heart-stopping danger. An overview of the French and Indian War follows the story. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He is also the author of <em>50 Seasons: A History of the Nashville Symphony </em>and <em>Tennessee </em><em>State </em><em>Symbols. </em></p>A biography of aviator Cornelia Fort, from her wealthy Nashville (Tenn.) childhood to her pioneering career as a pilot and early death. Simbeck, a seasoned professional writer, has consulted letters, books, and articles of the time, interviewing many of Fort's family members and friends. Born in 1919, she grew up on her family's farm with three older brothers and a younger sister, leading an active, privileged life bound only by the strict rules of her father, a medical doctor, successful businessman, and major landownerfirst citizen of the city. After watching the country-fair daredevil acts of early barnstorming aviators, the father made his sons take an oath never to take up flying, but he never reckoned on Cornelia, his feisty debutante-to-be daughter. Against her father's wishes, she attended progressive Sarah Lawrence College and relished the lifestyle of the rich and famous in nearby New York City. After her father's death, she broke away from her family's social restraints and took flying lessons from a veteran aviator, becoming hooked on the freedom of the skies. Later she found herself as a licensed instructor with a student in the air over Pearl Harbor as the Japanese struck. After landing, Fort and the student jumped out and ran for their lives as the plane was riddled with bullets on the ground. Simbeck describes the early days of the US entry into WWII, as about 100 experienced female pilots were invited to form the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS), to transport training planes from factories to air bases to free up men for combat training. Fort tragically died at 24 while trying new formation flying. As the war ended, the 1,100 female pilots were discharged as WASPS (Women's Airforce Service Pilots). An unusual story of a gallant young spirit who loved her country and died in its service. Another tribute to the ``greatest generation'' of WWII. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It had been around the neighborhood for several days, darting here and there, dodging traffic sometimes, and Arthur had been trying to catch it, setting the Havahart cage in the yard and baiting it with anchovies, but even though the kitten seemed desperately hungry, it would not enter the trap. It only sat and looked at the bait, and at them. But there was no big rush. Arthur had plenty of money and plenty of time to mess with stuff like that whenever he wasn't sitting in front of the big-screen TV watching westerns. Sometimes he dozed off. </p><p> He brought his coffee to the love seat where Helen was watching through the big bay window. Outside was late afternoon, cold and wind, a cloudy sky, no sun. A few cars passed out on South Parkway. She hadn't switched to whiskey yet, was just having some red wine so far, holding her glass in both hands. Arthur sat carefully down with her. Snow was dusting down in the yard, tiny flakes whirling in the chilly breezes. He could see it swirling across the street. It was cozy there next to her and he thought maybe he could get it up today, if he got the chance. </p><p> "I think it smells us," she said. </p><p> Arthur sipped his coffee and with her looked at the kitten. He kept thinking maybe he could find something that would occupy some of her time. He thought maybe she'd like a cat, so he was trying for one. </p><p> "What do you mean 'smells us'? We're in here. It's out there. How can it smell us?" </p><p> "I don't mean in here, silly. I mean maybe it smells us on the trap. Our scent." </p><p> Scent, Arthur mused. He guessed it was possible. Just about anything was possible, looked like. Even getting to be seventy. He'd charged the trap to his American Express card and he'd seen drinks from the Peabody bar again on last month's statement. She seemed to be going over there a lot lately. He tried to get her to always take cabs since the trouble with the police. Sometimes she did. </p><p> "Don't you know anything about trapping?" she said. </p><p> "Hm? No," said Arthur. "But I'll bet you do." She knew a bit of information about a lot of things. She could converse on different subjects. She could converse fluently on penile dysfunction. She'd read a booklet about it, and he thought she might have seen a television program about it as well. She could watch the bloodiest show on TV, <i>The Operation,</i> and he didn't want to be in the same room with it. He wondered where else she went to drink besides the Peabody. She never told him anything. </p><p> "Well," she said. "I read a book by somebody. Trappers have to cover their scent or the animals will smell them and go away. They have to boil their traps in wood ashes and things like that to remove their scent. They have to wear gloves, and if they're trapping something really smart, like a wolf or a coyote, they can't even touch the ground." </p><p> Arthur glanced at her. It was plain to anybody that she was a lot younger than him. He knew other men looked at her. He knew for a fact without having any way of proving it besides hiding in the lobby ferns and spying on her that she talked to strange men at the Peabody. </p><p> "Come on. How can they trap if they don't touch the ground?" </p><p> "They have to put down something to kneel on." </p><p> "Like what?" </p><p> "I don't know. Some old sacks or something." </p><p> "Do they have to boil the sacks?" </p><p> "I don't know." </p><p> "You think we need to boil our trap?" </p><p> "I just think it smells us. Look at the way it keeps watching us." </p><p> Arthur watched the kitten watching them for a while. </p><p> "You don't even have a pot big enough to boil it in," he said. "That thing's two feet long. How about spraying some Lysol on it?" </p><p> Helen gave him her patient look and sipped her wine. He remembered a time when she'd clamp her lovely muscular thighs around his back like the jaws of a new bear trap. She'd be gasping, with her head thrown back and her mouth opening and closing and her fingers in his hair yanking, going, Oh my <i>God, baby!</i> That was a long time ago, true. Way back in Montana. Still. </p><p> "Be serious," she said. </p><p> "I <i>am</i> serious. I already bought some cat food, didn't I? I already spent fifty-two dollars and fifty cents for the trap, didn't I?" </p><p> They sat studying the kitten. It walked around the wire box, looked back at them, sniffed at the contraption. Finally it sat again in the dead grass and stared at the anchovies. Maybe its tail was just deformed. </p><p> "Looks like if it was hungry it would go on in there," Arthur said. </p><p> "It's got to be hungry. Look how skinny it is." </p><p> "How are you going to tame it down even if we catch it?" </p><p> "I'll cure it with kindness, I guess." </p><p> "What if it claws you? You ever been attacked by a cat?" </p><p> "No, but I know you have." </p><p> "They can be pretty vicious if they get mad." </p><p> "That's true." </p><p> "They can whip a grown dog if they make up their mind to." </p><p> "I've heard that." </p><p> "And if you get scratched, why then you've got that cat-scratch fever to worry about. Like in this Ted Nugent song I heard one time." </p><p> "Well, if I get scratched, I'll put some peroxide on it." </p><p> "Or alcohol," Arthur said, and sipped his coffee. They stayed there for a quiet period of time, just watching the kitten. Arthur looked at Helen, but Helen didn't look at him. He sat there a little longer. Her slip was sticking out just a bit past her knee. Arthur very smoothly moved his hand over to her knee. He didn't need any Viagra pill to schedule a hard-on for him.

Cathy's creator, Cathy Guisewite, has collaborated with food editor Barbara Albright to create a volume of recipes to help Cathy's female fans cope with real-life maddening males. Fortunately for Cathy, the foods that comfort her are simple ones, easily prepared, but their titles have more words than the ingredient list. Hence, the book suggests an "After Five Hundred and Two Dinners and Four Hundred and Twenty-Seven Cups of Coffee, I Think It's Time to Get Serious Marry Me Mousse," an airy foam of chocolate and whipped cream perfumed with raspberry liqueur. Cathy's comforting foods divide into such categories as "Romance Food," dinners with seduction potential; "Swimsuit Food," low-fat dishes for shedding pounds; and "Sweat Suit Food," food to console while avoiding exercise.

The Peace of Amiens ends the long war with Napoleon Bonaparte's France, but Captain Alan Lewrie, Royal Navy, is appalled by its consequences. What is a dashing and successful frigate captain to <i>do</i> with himself ashore on half-pay? And <i>where</i> will Lewrie twiddle his thumbs until the war begins again, as he's sure it will? Rejoin his wife and in-laws who (mostly) despise him like the Devil hates Holy Water, on his rented farm in Surrey? Peace and domesticity are hellish hard on the rakehells!<br> Yet by the spring of 1802, Lewrie and his Caroline have <i>somewhat</i> reconciled and are off to make a go of a second honeymoon&#x2015;in Paris, France, of all places! There, Lewrie finds himself rubbing shoulders with soldiers, spies, and even First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte himself. When Lewrie <i>can't help</i> spurring Napoleon into a "kick-furniture" rage, he and Caroline must flee for their lives.<br> When war breaks out again in May of 1803, Lewrie has fresh orders, a new frigate, and a chance to punish and pursue the French, but it's no longer for duty or king and country&#x2015;now it's personal!</p></p><p><p>DEWEY LAMBDIN is the author of fifteen previous Alan Lewrie novels.

It was a sullen endeavour for Thermopylae&#x2019;s people, for the Dutch had not much of a fleet left since the Battle of Camperdown, four years before, in 1797, when Adm. Duncan had caught them, headed for the English Channel to combine with their French masters&#x2019; fleet for an invasion of Great Britain, had forced them to run for home close inshore of their own coast, where Duncan had given them the choice of wrecking on their own shoals or fighting, and had taken, sunk, or burned almost all of them. By now, the few surviving Batavian warships&nbsp; were slowly rotting away at their moorings, their new construction rotting on the stocks, and all their vaunting plans for a larger fleet scrapped. <br>Sullen, too, was the general attitude aboard Thermopylae after months of dull blockade duty, for it could not hold a candle to the heady and dar�ing adventures of the first of the year of 1801. As the League of Armed Neutrality had readied their navies to confront the Royal Navy, it had been Thermopylae that had been ordered into the Baltic&#x2014;alone!&#x2014;to &#x201c;smoak out&#x201d; the types and numbers of ships being prepared in Danish, Swedish, and Russian harbours, to determine the thickness of the ice that kept all Baltic navies penned in port, and to ascertain how long it would be before the ice would melt and free them. <br>Oh, there&#x2019;d also been the delivery of a pair of Russian nobles to some�where as close as possible to St. Petersburg . . . one of whom had tried to kill their new captain as they&nbsp; were being set ashore, an attempted murder right by the entry-port . . . all over a London whore, of all things! . . . And for certain the younger Roosky was love-sick mad, but what could be expected of foreigners, and&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t their new captain a scrapper, thought <br>Out of the Baltic at last, and there&#x2019;d been their own British Expedition�ary squadrons under Vice- Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and Vice- Admiral Horatio Nelson, and they&#x2019;d been just in time to take part in the glorious Battle of Copenhagen and squash the Danes like so many roaches round the galley butter tubs! <br>All downhill from there, though; first cruising in the Baltic &#x2019;til mid�summer, watching first Vice- Admiral Parker go home (in a bit of dis�grace, the hands had heard-tell) then Nelson departing for his always fragile health, and, at last, a spell of re-victualling and repairs at Great Yarmouth, where the adventures had begun, and a spell of shore liberty. After that, Thermopylae had been seconded to the small North Sea Fleet to serve as a scout, doing much of a boresome much as they did this morning . . . making her presence known under reduced sail about two leagues seaward of the shoals, and counting windmills, for all they good &#x201c;people&#x201d; Thermo�pylae of &#x201c;people&#x201d; knew. <br>In a thin and fine mist on this particular morning, a cold early-October rain was falling and dripping in great dollops from sails and rigging, over a grey and dingy-white-foamed sea that chopped and hissed and imparted to the frigate a slow and queasy wallowing roll. And the wind . . . if freed, Thermopylae could cup that wind and rush like a Cambridge coach, high on eleven knots or better . . . yet that wind was wasted on her twice-reefed or gathered sails. And it was a nippy wind, to boot, a raw-un out of the Nor&#x2019;west, fresh from Arctic ice sheets that made nettled tars wish for their Franklin-pattern stoves to be set up on the gun-deck once again, blow warm breaths into cupped fists, and shiver under their tarred tarpau�lins. <br>HMS Thermopylae&#x2019;s Second Officer, Lt. James Fox, let out a pleased sigh as a ship&#x2019;s boy turned the half-hour glass, then slowly struck Eight Bells up by the forecastle. His watch was done, and hot tea or coff ee awaited him in the gun-room below, along with his breakfast. Lt. Fox clapped gloved hands together in joy as his replacement, his old chum Lt. Dick Farley, stepped from the lee side of the quarterdeck to amidships before the double- helm drum and the binnacle cabinet to assume command of the Forenoon Watch. <br>&#x201c;A thouroughly miserable day, and I wish ye joy of it, Dick,&#x201d; Lt. Fox said with a grin and a roll of his eyes. <br>&#x201c;Worse things happen at sea, Jemmy,&#x201d; Lt. Farley replied as he for�mally doff ed his hat, a second-best and much-battered old thing with its gilt lace gone verdigris green. Fox&#x2019;s&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t a whit better. <br>&#x201c;Just thinking that, in point of fact,&#x201d; Lt. Fox quipped. &#x201c;So, the usual . . . wind&#x2019;s still Nor&#x2019;westerly,&nbsp; we&#x2019;re beam- reaching, as anyone can clearly see, course Nor&#x2019;East, half East, and making six agonisingly slow knots. What&#x2019;s for breakfast?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Scrambled eggs, cheese, and biscuit, speaking of usual,&#x201d; Lt. Farley replied. &#x201c;Has the captain determined whether we&#x2019;ll exercise at the great-guns this morning?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hasn&#x2019;t said yet,&#x201d; Lt. Fox replied, letting a yawn escape him. &#x201c;Damme, I was hoping for hot porridge. Do we drill on the artillery, I&#x2019;d prefer a steadier point of sail.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aye, this roll&#x2019;d be a bugger,&#x201d; Lt. Farley agreed. <br>&#x201c;Well, I leave you to it, Dick,&#x201d; Fox said, cheering up. <br>&#x201c;I relieve you, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Farley said with another doff of his hat, and the Second Officer, along with his Midshipmen of the Watch, and the Starboard Watch of the quarterdeck and Afterguard,&nbsp; were scrambling below, some to their breakfasts, some to the uncertain warmth of the gun- deck. <br>Right aft, and just below the quarterdeck in the great-cabins, Captain Alan Lewrie was shaving . . . or trying to. It was not a chore comfortably, or safely, done in such a wallowing, rolling sea-way, in the small mirror of his wash- hand stand with a straight razor. Lewrie had to brace himself like a runner frozen in mid-stride, his left leg behind him and his right in front, balancing from one to the other as Thermopylae heaved from beam to beam like a metronome, about fifteen degrees or better to each roll. He could have sat himself down in a chair, but would be without the mirror, or the small enamelled basin that held his single pint of water ration for washing daily. <br>&#x201c;Get out of it, ye bloody little. . . . !&#x201d; Lewrie snapped as Chalky, the younger and spryer of his cats, leaped atop the wash- hand stand for the third time, fascinated in equal measure by the lapping water in the basin <br>and his reflection in the mirror. &#x201c;Shoo! Scat! Pettus!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; his cabin steward replied, carefully hiding his smile. <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there some amusement ye could offer him?&#x201d; Lewrie griped. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him, sir,&#x201d; Pettus off ered, coming to scoop up the white and grey-splotched cat and bear him away, spraddled atop his forearm. An instant later, and it was Toulon, the bigger and older (and clumsier) black�and-white tom that wished to see what had taken Chalky&#x2019;s attention, but his leap was just a tad off (blame it on the roll) and he went tumbling back to the deck, with the hand towel in his paws. Mrrf! he carped, tail bottled up in disgrace. Then Marr! as he looked up plaintively at Lewrie, as if to ask if he&#x2019;d seen that flub. <br>&#x201c;I still love ye t&#x2019;death, Toulon,&#x201d; Lewrie commiserated, bending down to retrieve the hand towel and give the embarrassed cat a &#x201c;wubbie&#x201d; or two. He had to grin, for there had been scraped-off&nbsp; shaving soap on the towel, and Toulon had gotten some of it on his whis kers, which made him go slightly cross-eyed trying to see it and swipe it off , sitting up rabbit- fashion and whacking away with both paws. <br>Thermopylae rose up to a rare scending wave and heaved another slow roll to starboard, timbers, masts and windward stays groaning in concert, and Lewrie half- staggered almost to amidships before catching himself. &#x201c;Mine arse on a band-box!&#x201d; he hissed under his breath, using one of his favourite expressions. That stagger involved some complicated foot stamp�ing, which only drove the cat under the starboard-side settee, into relative darkness where Toulon could blink in shame and in umbrage, consulting his cat gods. <br>The larboard roll took Lewrie back to the wash-hand stand, where he took a firm grip with one hand and braced himself for another stab at shaving. <br>&#x201c;Um . . . might you need me to do it for you, sir?&#x201d; Pettus asked. <br>&#x201c;No no, Pettus!&#x201d; Lewrie countered with a false grin on his phyz, &#x201c;Done for meself for years, in worse weather than this. Dined out on my dexterity!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you say so, sir,&#x201d; Pettus replied with a dubious expression. <br>Once he&#x2019;d scraped his whis kers as close as he dared, without cutting his own throat, Lewrie swabbed his face, tied his neck-stock, and donned his uniform coat. He made a careful way forrud to the dining-coach and his table, and his breakfast. <br>It was a Banyan Day, without any salt- meat issue, and after a miserable two months on blockade, a paltry and dull breakfast it was. There was oatmeal porridge, boiled up in water, not milk, and livened with a daub of rancid butter and a largish dollop of strawberry preserves. There was a slab of cheese from his own stores, not that crumbling, dry-as-sawdust Navy issue so beloved of the Victualling Board, but even that was begin�ning to go over, though showed no signs of red worms yet. And there was ship&#x2019;s biscuit. Lewrie had purchased extra-fine for himself, but it was tough going, even after being soaked in water for the better part of an hour before being served, and, did he wish to keep his remaining teeth, he&#x2019;d chew it hellish-careful. There was coffee,...</p><h2>The Battle of the Tanks: Kursk, 1943</h2><p>On July 5, 1943, the greatest land battle in history began when Nazi and Red Army forces clashed near the town of Kursk, on the western border of the Soviet Union. Code named Operation Citadel,&#x201d; the German offensive would cut through the bulge in the eastern front that had been created following Germany&#x2019;s retreat at the battle of Stalingrad. But the Soviets, well-informed about Germany&#x2019;s plans through their network of spies, had months to prepare. Two million men supported by 6,000 tanks, 35,000 guns, and 5,000 aircraft convened in Kursk for an epic confrontation that was one of the most important military engagements in history, the epitome of total war.&#x201d; It was also one of the most bloody, and despite suffering seven times more casualties, the Soviets won a decisive victory that became a turning point in the war. With unprecedented access to the journals and testimonials of the officers, soldiers, political leaders, and citizens who lived through it, <i>The Battle of the Tanks</i> is the definitive account of an epic showdown that changed the course of history.</p><p>Lloyd Clark is a senior academic in the Department of War Studies at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and Professorial Research Fellow in War Studies, Humanities Research Institute, at University of Buckingham. One of the UK&#x2019;s leading military historians, he is the author of <i>Anzio</i> and <i>Crossing the Rhine</i>.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Battle of the Tanks</i></b><br><br> Mr. Clark has a reputation for both his deep knowledge of military history and his ability to make it accessible to a substantial reading audience. That reputation is well deserved. While the tank battle at Kursk is the centerpiece of his work, Clark realizes, as would any good historian, that it did not take place in a vacuum. He places the great battle in its context, relating it to the events that preceded, and those which followed. It is in the telling of this dramatic tale that author Clark excels. In The Battle of the Tanks, it is the men who fought there who tell the story of the great and fateful encounter.&#x201d; <i>The New York Journal of Books</i><br><br>"His narrative is both moving in its use of testimony of ordinary soldiers and insightful in its interpretation of the generals&#x2019; strategy." <i>The Sunday Times</i> (UK)<br><br>"A comprehensive analysis of WWII&#x2019;s greatest land battle and one of history&#x2019;s greatest armor engagements. [Clark] blends archival research, participant interviews, and professional insight in presenting the genesis, conduct, and consequences of the Battle of Kursk. Particularly effective is his integration of foxhole and tank-crew perspectives with broader discussion of the course of a headdown slugging match that decisively tipped the Eastern Front&#x2019;s balance in favor of a resurgent Red Army. With this account, Clark confirms his reputation as one of Britain&#x2019;s outstanding scholars of operational military history." <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"A leading British military historian reconsiders the events of World War II this time, on the decisive yet less-trammeled Eastern Front. In this deeply informed overview, Clark offers an authoritative appraisal of the total war&#x201d; engulfing both Germany and the Soviet Union. Vigorous depictions of German and Soviet military leaders alternate with the words of ordinary soldiers and richly described specifications of military hardware." <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"An experienced and literate military historian gives us a stellar account of the Battle of Kursk in 1943, one of the more obscure of WWII&#x2019;s decisive battles... The German Panzer forces on the Eastern Front never recovered their offensive capabilities, and the author has shown why in vivid, sometimes harrowing, detail, making extensive use of Russian sources only recently made available. A major addition to the literature of the Eastern Front, the decisive land theater of WWII." <i>Booklist</i><br><br> Lloyd Clark belongs to a new generation of British military historians who appeal to both scholars and general readers; he has written successful works on Anzio and the British Rhine campaign of 1944 45. This offering is no less solid: well researched and well written, it integrates frontline narratives and operational analysis... What sets this work firmly apart, however, is Clark&#x2019;s recognition that while Kursk was a battle of the tanks,&#x2019; it was above all a soldiers&#x2019; battle... Men, not machines, were the deciding factor.&#x201d; Dennis Showalter, <i>WWII Magazine</i><br></p><h2>Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death</h2><p>Brand new!

Reconnaissance planes brought back photographs of barracks and airfields and fleets of ships in the Wash; General George S. Patton was seen in his unmistakable pink jodhpurs walking his white bulldog; there were bursts of wireless activity, signals between regiments in the area; confirming signs were reported by German spies in Britain.</p><p>There was no army, of course. The ships were rubber-and-timber fakes, the barracks no more real than a movie set; Patton did not have a single man under his command; the radio signals were meaningless; the spies were double agents.</p><p>The object was to fool the enemy into preparing for an invasion via the Pas de Calais, so that on D-Day the Normandy assault would have the advantage of surprise.</p><p>It was a huge, near-impossible deception. Literally thousands of people were involved in perpetrating the trick. It would have been a miracle if none of Hitler&#x2019;s spies ever got to know about it.</p><p>Were there any spies? At the time people thought they were surrounded by what were then called Fifth Columnists. After the war a myth grew up that MI5 had rounded up the lot by Christmas 1939. The truth seems to be that there were very few; MI5 did capture nearly all of them.</p><p>But it only needs one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>It is known that the Germans saw the signs they were meant to see in East Anglia. It is also known that they suspected a trick, and that they tried very hard to discover the truth.</p><p>That much is history. What follows is fiction.</p><p>Still and all, one suspects something like this must have happened.</p><p><i>Camberley, Surrey, June 1977</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>IT was the coldest winter for forty-five years. Villages in the English countryside were cut off by the snow and the Thames froze over. One day in January the Glasgow-London train arrived at Euston twenty-four hours late. The snow and the blackout combined to make motoring perilous; road accidents doubled, and people told jokes about how it was more risky to drive an Austin Seven along Piccadilly at night than to take a tank across the Siegfried Line.</p><p>Then, when the spring came, it was glorious. Barrage balloons floated majestically in bright blue skies, and soldiers on leave flirted with girls in sleeveless dresses on the streets of London.</p><p>The city did not look much like the capital of a nation at war. There were signs, of course; and Henry Faber, cycling from Waterloo Station toward Highgate, noted them: piles of sandbags outside important public buildings, Anderson shelters in suburban gardens, propaganda posters about evacuation and Air Raid Precautions. Faber watched such things&#x2014;he was considerably more observant than the average railway clerk. He saw crowds of children in the parks, and concluded that evacuation had been a failure. He marked the number of motorcars on the road, despite petrol rationing; and he read about the new models announced by the motor manufacturers. He knew the significance of night-shift workers pouring into factories where, only months previously, there had been hardly enough work for the day shift. Most of all, he monitored the movement of troops around Britain&#x2019;s railway network; all the paperwork passed through his office. One could learn a lot from that paperwork. Today, for example, he had rubber-stamped a batch of forms that led him to believe that a new Expeditionary Force was being gathered. He was fairly sure that it would have a complement of about 100,000 men, and that it was for Finland.</p><p>There were signs, yes; but there was something jokey about it all. Radio shows satirized the red tape of wartime regulations, there was community singing in the air raid shelters, and fashionable women carried their gas masks in couturier-designed containers. They talked about the Boer War. It was at once larger-than-life and trivial, like a moving picture show. All the air raid warnings, without exception, had been false alarms.</p><p>Faber had a different point of view&#x2014;but then, he was a different kind of person.</p><p>He steered his cycle into Archway Road and leaned forward a little to take the uphill slope, his long legs pumping as tirelessly as the pistons of a railway engine. He was very fit for his age, which was thirty-nine, although he lied about it; he lied about most things, as a safety precaution.</p><p>He began to perspire as he climbed the hill into Highgate. The building in which he lived was one of the highest in London, which was why he chose to live there. It was a Victorian brick house at one end of a terrace of six. The houses were high, narrow and dark, like the minds of the men for whom they had been built. Each had three stories plus a basement with a servants&#x2019; entrance&#x2014;the English middle class of the nineteenth century insisted on a servants&#x2019; entrance, even if they had no servants. Faber was a cynic about the English.</p><p>Number Six had been owned by Mr. Harold Garden, of Garden&#x2019;s Tea and Coffee, a small company that went broke in the Depression. Having lived by the principle that insolvency is a mortal sin, the bankrupt Mr. Garden had no option but to die. The house was all he bequeathed to his widow, who was then obliged to take in boarders. She enjoyed being a landlady, although the etiquette of her social circle demanded that she pretend to be a little ashamed of it. Faber had a room on the top floor with a dormer window. He lived there from Monday to Friday, and told Mrs. Garden that he spent weekends with his mother in Erith. In fact, he had another landlady in Blackheath, who called him Mr. Baker and believed he was a traveling salesman for a stationery manufacturer and spent all week on the road.</p><p>He wheeled his cycle up the garden path under the disapproving frown of the tall front-room windows. He put it in the shed and padlocked it to the lawn mower&#x2014;it was against the law to leave a vehicle unlocked. The seed potatoes in boxes all around the shed were sprouting. Mrs. Garden had turned her flower beds over to vegetables for the war effort.</p><p>Faber entered the house, hung his hat on the hall-stand, washed his hands and went in to tea.</p><p>Three of the other lodgers were already eating: a pimply boy from Yorkshire who was trying to get into the Army; a confectionery salesman with receding sandy hair; and a retired naval officer who, Faber was convinced, was a degenerate. Faber nodded to them and sat down.</p><p>The salesman was telling a joke. &#x201c;So the Squadron Leader says, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re back early!&#x2019; and the pilot turns round and says, &#x2018;Yes, I dropped my leaflets in bundles&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t that right?&#x2019; So the Squadron Leader says, &#x2018;Good God! You might&#x2019;ve hurt somebody!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The naval officer cackled and Faber smiled. Mrs. Garden came in with a teapot. &#x201c;Good evening, Mr. Faber. We started without you&#x2014;I hope you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>Faber spread margarine thinly on a slice of wholemeal bread, and momentarily yearned for a fat sausage. &#x201c;Your seed potatoes are ready to plant,&#x201d; he told her.</p><p>Faber hurried through his tea. The others were arguing over whether Chamberlain should be sacked and replaced by Churchill. Mrs. Garden kept voicing opinions, then looking at Faber for a reaction. She was a blowsy woman, a little overweight. About Faber&#x2019;s age, she wore the clothes of a woman of thirty, and he guessed she wanted another husband. He kept out of the discussion.</p><p>Mrs. Garden turned on the radio. It hummed for a while; then an announcer said: &#x201c;This is the BBC Home Service. <i>It&#x2019;s That Man Again!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Faber had heard the show. It regularly featured a German spy called Funf. He excused himself and went up to his room.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Mrs. Garden was left alone after <i>It&#x2019;s That Man Again</i>; the naval officer went to the pub with the salesman; and the boy from Yorkshire, who was religious, went to a prayer meeting. She sat in the parlor with a small glass of gin, looking at the blackout curtains and thinking about Mr. Faber. She wished he wouldn&#x2019;t spend so much time in his room. She needed company, and he was the kind of company she needed.</p><p>Such thoughts made her feel guilty. To assuage the guilt, she thought of Mr. Garden. Her memories were familiar but blurred, like an old print of a movie with worn sprocket holes and an indistinct sound track; so that, although she could easily remember what it was like to have him here in the room with her, it was difficult to imagine his face or the clothes he might be wearing or the comment he would make on the day&#x2019;s war news. He had been a small, dapper man, successful in business when he was lucky and unsuccessful when he was not, undemonstrative in public and insatiably affectionate in bed. She had loved him a lot. There would be many women in her position if this war ever got going properly. She poured another drink.</p><p>Mr. Faber was a quiet one&#x2014;that was the trouble. He didn&#x2019;t seem to have any vices. He didn&#x2019;t smoke, she had never smelled drink on his breath, and he spent every evening in his room, listening to classical music on his radio. He read a lot of newspapers and went for long walks. She suspected he was quite clever, despite his humble job: his contributions to the conversation in the dining room were always a shade more thoughtful than anyone else&#x2019;s. He surely could get a better job if he tried. He seemed not to give himself the chance he deserved.</p><p>It was the same with his appearance. He was a fine figure of a man: tall, quite heavy around the neck and shoulders, not a bit fat, with long legs. And he had a strong face, with a high forehead and a long jaw and bright blue eyes&#x2014;not pretty like a film star, but the kind of face that appealed to a woman. Except for the mouth&#x2014;that was small and thin, and she could imagine him being cruel. Mr. Garden had been incapable of cruelty.</p><p>And yet at first sight he was not the kind of a man a woman would look at twice. The trousers of his old worn suit were never pressed&#x2014;she would have done that for him, and gladly, but he never asked&#x2014;and he always wore a shabby raincoat and a flat docker&#x2019;s cap. He had no mustache, and his hair was trimmed short every fortnight. It was as if he wanted to look like a nonentity.</p><p>He needed a woman; there was no doubt of that. She wondered for a moment whether he might be what people called effeminate, but she dismissed the idea quickly. He needed a wife to smarten him up and give him ambition. She needed a man to keep her company and for&#x2014;well&#x2014;love.</p><p>Yet he never made a move. Sometimes she could scream with frustration. She was sure she was attractive. She looked in a mirror as she poured another gin. She had a nice face and fair curly hair, and there was something for a man to get hold of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She giggled at that thought. She must be getting tiddly.</p><p>She sipped her drink and considered whether <i>she </i>ought to make the first move. Mr. Faber was obviously shy&#x2014;chronically shy. He wasn&#x2019;t sexless&#x2014;she could tell by the look in his eyes on the two occasions he had seen her in her nightdress. Perhaps she could overcome his shyness by being brazen. What did she have to lose? She tried imagining the worst, just to see what it felt like. Suppose he rejected her. Well, it would be embarrassing&#x2014;even humiliating. It would be a blow to her pride. But nobody else need know it had happened. He would just have to leave.</p><p>The thought of rejection had put her off the whole idea. She got to her feet slowly, thinking: I&#x2019;m just not the brazen type. It was bedtime. If she had one more gin in bed she would be able to sleep. She took the bottle upstairs.</p><p>Her bedroom was below Mr. Faber&#x2019;s, and she could hear violin music from his radio as she undressed. She put on a new nightdress&#x2014;pink, with an embroidered neckline, and no one to see it!&#x2014;and made her last drink. She wondered what Mr. Faber looked like undressed. He would have a flat stomach and hairs on his nipples, and you would be able to see his ribs because he was slim. He probably had a small bottom. She giggled again, thinking, I&#x2019;m a disgrace.</p><p>She took her drink to bed and picked up her book, but it was too much effort to focus on the print. Besides, she was bored with vicarious romance. Stories about dangerous love affairs were fine when you yourself had a perfectly safe love affair with your husband, but a woman needed more than Barbara Cartland. She sipped her gin and wished Mr. Faber would turn the radio off. It was like trying to sleep at a tea dance!</p><p>She could, of course, ask him to turn it off. She looked at her bedside clock; it was past ten. She could put on her dressing gown, which matched the nightdress, and just comb her hair a little, then step into her slippers&#x2014;quite dainty, with a pattern of roses&#x2014;and just pop up the stairs to the next landing, and just, well, tap on his door. He would open it, perhaps wearing his trousers and under- shirt, and then he would <i>look </i>at her the way he had <i>looked </i>when he saw her in her nightdress on the way to the bathroom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Silly old fool,&#x201d; she said to herself aloud. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just making excuses to go up there.&#x201d;</p><p>And then she wondered why she needed excuses. She was a grown-up, and it was her house, and in ten years she had not met another man who was just right for her, and what the <i>hell</i>? She needed to feel someone strong and hard and hairy on top of her, squeezing her breasts and panting in her ear and parting her thighs with his broad, flat hands, for tomorrow the gas bombs might come over from Germany and they would all die choking and gasping and poisoned and she would have lost her last chance.</p><p>So she drained her glass and got out of bed and put on her dressing gown, and just combed her hair a little and stepped into her slippers, and picked up her bunch of keys in case he had locked the door and couldn&#x2019;t hear her knock above the sound of the radio.</p><p>There was nobody on the landing. She found the stairs in the darkness. She intended to step over the stair that creaked, but she stumbled on the loose carpet and trod on it heavily; but it seemed that nobody heard, so she went on up and tapped on the door at the top. She tried it gently. It was locked.</p><p>The radio was turned down and Mr. Faber called out, &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>He was well-spoken, not cockney or foreign&#x2014;not anything, really, just a pleasantly neutral voice.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;Can I have a word with you?&#x201d;</p><p>He seemed to hesitate; then he said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m undressed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I,&#x201d; she giggled, and she opened the door with her duplicate key.</p><p>He was standing in front of the radio with some kind of screwdriver in his hand. He wore his trousers and <i>no </i>undershirt. His face was white and he looked scared to death.</p><p>She stepped inside and closed the door behind her, not knowing what to say. Suddenly she remembered a line from an American film, and she said, &#x201c;Would you buy a lonely girl a drink?&#x201d; It was silly, really, because she knew he had no drink in his room and she certainly wasn&#x2019;...</p></p><h2>Joseph Smith&#39;s Seer Stones</h2><p><p>When the Church released photos of the brown seer stone that was owned and used by Joseph Smith, the news ignited a firestorm of curiosity and controversy. People wanted more information and wondered why they hadn't been aware of the stone's existence.</p> <p>This book discusses the origins of Joseph Smith's seer stones and explores how Joseph used them throughout his life in a way that goes beyond translating the Book of Mormon. It also traces the provenance of his stones once they left his possessions. The authors examine how the Book of Mormon itself provides a storyline about the history of seer stones and how this helped Joseph Smith learn about his own prophetic gifts.</p></p><p><p>Michael Hubbard MacKay received an engineering degree from the US Air Force and a master's degree from the University of York in England, focusing on world history, culture, and the history of science and medicine.

Commander Norton and his crew take their ship to meet it, and, once inside, discover the wonders that go to make up Rama.</p><p>An all-time science fiction classic, <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> is also one of Clarke's best novels--it won the Campbell, Hugo, Jupiter, and Nebula Awards. A huge, mysterious, cylindrical object appears in space, swooping in toward the sun. The citizens of the solar system send a ship to investigate before the enigmatic craft, called Rama, disappears. The astronauts given the task of exploring the hollow cylindrical ship are able to decipher some, but definitely not all, of the extraterrestrial vehicle's puzzles. From the ubiquitous trilateral symmetry of its structures to its cylindrical sea and machine-island, Rama's secrets are strange evidence of an advanced civilization. But who, and where, are the Ramans, and what do they want with humans? Perhaps the answer lies with the busily working biots, or the sealed-off buildings, or the inaccessible "southern" half of the enormous cylinder. Rama's unsolved mysteries are tantalizing indeed. <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> is fast moving, fascinating, and a must-read for science fiction fans. Clarke collaborated with Gentry Lee in writing several Rama sequels, beginning with <i>Rama II</i>.At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredible, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams... and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits -- just behind a Raman airlock door.<p> "Mr. Clarke is splendid...We experience that chilling touch of the alien, the not-quite-knowable, that distinguishes SF at its most technically imaginative." -- <i>The New York Times</i></p></p><h2>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER �&nbsp;The official novelization of <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens,</i> the blockbuster film directed by J.

His novel <i>Cyber Way</i> won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction, the first science fiction work ever to do so. Foster and his wife, JoAnn Oxley, live in Prescott, Arizona.Poe saw the saber come to life. Saw it start to describe its lethal arc. Time seemed to slow as he watched it descend. Thoughts raced through his mind, half crazed, wholly powerless. He heard himself yelling, sensed himself raising his blaster and firing. Too late, too slow, he told himself despondently even as he continued to fire. <br> &nbsp;<br> Perceiving the threat, Kylo Ren reacted immediately. A hand rose sharply, palm facing toward the unknown assailant. The gesture was merely the physical manifestation of something infinitely more powerful and entirely unseen. It intercepted the discharge from the pilot&#x2019;s weapon, freezing it in midair as effectively as any solid barrier. From behind the mask, eyes of preternatural intensity tracked the attack to its source. <br> &nbsp;<br> Initially driven by pure rage, Poe now found that he could not move. His heart pounded, his lungs heaved, but his voluntary muscles refused to respond. He was paralyzed as effectively as the blast from his blaster. <br> &nbsp;<br> A pair of stormtroopers took hold of him and dragged him for- ward until he stood helpless before the impassive Ren. Had they not held on to him, Poe would simply have fallen over. He attempted bravado even so. &#x201c;Who talks first?&#x201d; Poe asked, making his voice light. &#x201c;Do you talk first? Do I talk first?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Having deactivated his lightsaber and returned it to his belt, Lor San Tekka&#x2019;s murderer casually scrutinized the prisoner. Poe&#x2019;s nerves twanged as feeling slowly began to return to his arms and legs. Ren&#x2019;s gaze settled on the details of the pilot&#x2019;s clothing. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A Resistance pilot, by the looks of him.&#x201d; He nodded curtly. &#x201c;Search him. Thoroughly.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> One of the troopers who had dragged Poe forward commenced a detailed and none too gentle pat down. Pulling a small device from his service belt, the other trooper slowly passed it the length of the prisoner&#x2019;s body, beginning at the pilot&#x2019;s head and ending at his feet. The examination did not take long. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; declared the first stormtrooper, standing at attention. Poe winked up at the trooper who had used his hands. &#x201c;Good job.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Forgetting himself for a moment, the goaded trooper kicked the prisoner&#x2019;s legs out from under him. Poe went down hard on his knees, still defiant. <br> &nbsp;<br> The other trooper gestured with the handheld instrument. &#x201c;Same here, sir. Internally, this one is clean. Nothing but the expected food residue.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Terminate him?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kylo Ren did not let his disappointment show. At such times momentary delays were not unexpected. All would be satisfactorily resolved, in good time. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. Keep him.&#x201d; A brief pause, then, &#x201c;Intact and functioning.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Plainly disappointed, the two troopers dragged Poe away. Ren watched them for a moment, contemplating possibilities. <i>Later</i>, he told himself. For now, there were other details to attend to. He allowed his thoughts to be briefly diverted, regretting the time that had been wasting in dealing with necessary inconsequentialities. <br> &nbsp;<br> Awaiting his pleasure, the senior officer in overall charge of the special squadrons drew herself up at his approach, her black cape of rank hanging loose around her. It stood in startling contrast to her armor, which even in the poor light shone like polished silver. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your orders, sir?&#x201d; she murmured. <br> &nbsp;<br> Kylo Ren surveyed his blazing surroundings. He had already spent too much time here, to only partial satisfaction. He disliked such delays. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kill them all, Captain Phasma, and search the village. Every building, every possible storage facility and place of concealment. When your troops have razed it to the ground, search the ground. Scanners, perceptors. You know what to look for.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A single nod and she turned. A line of troopers stood before the assembled surviving villagers. &#x201c;On my command!&#x201d; Weapons were raised. The reactions of the villagers were typical. Some stepped forward, insolent to the last. Others fell to their knees. There was whimpering and crying and shouts of defiance. None of it lasted very long. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Fire!&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t a massacre. In the lexicon of the First Order it was nothing more than a prescribed chastisement. Appropriate retribution for harboring a fugitive of note. It was the nature of the tutorial that was important, not the numbers involved. It took less than a minute. <br> &nbsp;<br> When it was over, and the only sounds were methodical chatter among the troopers mixed with a variety of unholy crackling, they dispersed to carry out a final survey and scan of the debris&#x2014;inorganic and otherwise. Standing by himself, one trooper with a bloody face mask was startled when a hand came down on his shoulder. Though the hand belonged to a comrade, the first trooper did not relax. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Notice you didn&#x2019;t fire. Blaster jam?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Automatically, the trooper being questioned nodded in response. His comrade gestured knowingly and clapped him on the shoulder. &#x201c;Turn it in when we get back to base. Let the tech boys deal with it and get yourself a new one.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thanks. I will.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> No sooner had his helpful colleague departed to rejoin his own unit than the trooper found himself gaping at the tall, dark-clad figure striding purposefully toward the singular shuttle that had set down in the midst of battle. Though he willed himself to move, to turn away, he found he could not. He remained rooted in place, clutching his unfired weapon, staring despite himself. <br> &nbsp;<br> And in response, the figure of Kylo Ren turned and looked sideways, directly at the soldier. The trooper saw only light reflecting off a mask, and his own fear. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>He knows. He must know. And I&#x2019;m . . . dead</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> But he wasn&#x2019;t. The glance lasted barely a second. Then Ren resumed his pace, deep in thought as he strode toward the shuttle. In the course of returning to his ship he passed a blaster lying on the ground. It was Poe&#x2019;s, the one that had come within an arm&#x2019;s length of killing him. Once he was beyond its reach he touched it&#x2014;but not with his hands. It rose, seemingly of its own accord, and flew free, smashing into a nearby structure and scaring the wits out of an idling stormtrooper unfortunate enough to be standing nearby. <br> &nbsp;<br> The purification of the village extended to its outskirts, where a clutch of troopers had just finished searching the damaged X-wing that had been abandoned there. Having done all they could with the tools and equipment at hand, they prepared to return to their units. Specialized gear could have reduced the Resistance fighter to its component parts, but that was not how they had been ordered to proceed. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing there,&#x201d; declared the last of the quartet as he descended from the fighter&#x2019;s cockpit. &#x201c;The usual Resistance trash; that&#x2019;s all. Deep scan shows nothing in the fuselage or elsewhere.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> As soon as he was safely out of range, his companions activated the pair of heavy weapons they had brought to bear on the hiding place. A couple of bursts was all it took to reduce both ship and outcropping to rubble. <br> &nbsp;<br> The sound of the exploding X-wing reverberated across the gravel flats and dunes. Far away now, a solitary spherical droid looked back even as it continued to flee. The fireball that rose into the sky suggested the detonation of something far more volatile than primitive buildings and scrapped mechanicals. If he could have rolled faster, the frightened droid would have done so. <br> &nbsp;<br> Contrary to much popular thought, desert worlds are not quiet at night. In the absence of light, an entirely different ecology springs to life. Moving with greater caution, BB-8 tried not to pause at each howl, every <i>meep</i>, the sounds of clawed feet scraping against bare rock. There were things in the vacant, wild regions of underdeveloped planets that would gladly take apart a solitary droid just to see what made it tick. Or roll, he knew. His internal gyros threatened to send him tumbling wildly at the very thought of such an encounter. <br> &nbsp;<br> Droids such as him were not meant for unpopulated places, and he desperately desired to find others like himself. Or, failing that, even people. <br> &nbsp;<br> The shackles that Poe had worn on the troop transport were removed as soon as he and his captors disembarked. Aboard the Star Destroyer, there was no reason to physically restrain the prisoner. Apparently enjoying themselves, or perhaps merely impatient to get out of their armor, his escort chivvied him along with what he considered to be unnecessary roughness. Not that stormtroopers of any ilk were noted for their individual diplomacy. Considering whom he had tried to shoot, he knew he ought to consider himself fortunate that they had brought him aboard still attached to all his important appendages. <br> &nbsp;<br> A physical state of being, he knew, that could be altered at any moment. <br> &nbsp;<br> On the other side of the enormous and impressive receiving bay, other troopers were filing out, grateful that more of their number had not been lost on the expedition and looking forward to some rest and food. Intent on reliving the battle below, they paid no attention to one of their own who fell behind. When he was convinced no one was looking at him, the trooper turned and raced back into the open transport. He removed his helmet and proceeded to void the contents of his stomach into the nearest refuse receptacle. The terror in his expression was palpable. Fortunately, there was no one there to witness his disgrace. <br> &nbsp;<br> There was, however, now someone behind him. <br> &nbsp;<br> Terror gave way to cold fear as he found himself gazing back at Captain Phasma. How much had the senior officer seen? How much did she know? Too much, as it turned out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aloof yet commanding, she indicated the rifle he still carried. &#x201c;FN-2187. I understand you experienced some difficulty with your weapon. Please be so good as to submit it for inspection by your division&#x2019;s technical team.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Captain.&#x201d; How he managed to reply without stammering he did not know. Instinct as opposed to training, he decided. Self- preservation. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He swallowed hard. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Captain.&#x201d;&nbsp;He could feel her disgust as he struggled to put the helmet back over his head. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Report to my division at once,&#x201d; Phasma said.

Despite her age, she was already a veteran actress, living a charmed life, moving from one Hollywood set to the next. But behind the scenes, her success was fueled by the pride, pressure, and sometimes grinding cruelty of her stage mother, as fame and a mother's ambition pushed her older sister deeper into the shadows. <i>Diary of a Stage Mother's Daughter</i> is a fascinating account of life as a child star in the 1980's, and also a startling tale of a family under the care of a highly neurotic, dangerously competitive "tiger mother." But perhaps most importantly, now that Melissa has two sons of her own, it's a meditation on motherhood, and the value of pushing your children: how hard should you push a child to succeed, and at what point does your help turn into harm?</p><p><p>A graduate of Harvard University, <b>Melissa Francis</b> grew up in southern California.&nbsp;As a broadcast journalist, she has anchored CNBC's <i>Power Lunch</i>, <i>The Call</i>, and <i>On The Money,</i> served as a regular contributor to the <i>Today</i> show and <i>Weekend Today</i> Show, and currently hosts two daily business shows on the Fox Business Network.&nbsp;She lives in New York City with her husband and their two sons.</p>"I am always in search of the book I can't put down.

This book is a late dividend of a long professional career that has been almost exclusively invested in Utah and its neighboring states. Through this book, Utahns have a unique opportunity to appreciate their geologic heritage. An unusually large segment of earth's history is recorded in over 250 formations that crop out in different areas of the state and virtually every geologic influence that shaped the earth - lakes, glaciers, wind, igneous action, tectonic forces, and erosion have left unmistakable impressions. Utah's economy is more closely linked to geology than most other states. In the past, the state relied upon the mining and energy industries and now tourism, based mainly on geologic attractions, is a major source of income. Also, the design and construction of nearly every major structure in Utah should consider geology because few other states have Utah's vulnerability to the geologic hazards associated with earthquakes, landslides, rockfalls, unstable soil conditions, high ground water, floods, liquefaction, and shifting lakes. <br><br> Probably no area of similar size in the U.S. displaces more of the raw, unobscured rock formations than does Utah. Due to the scarcity of soil, not only do rock formations appear with unobscured clarity, they also occur in great variety. Over 500 have been recognized including igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary units of all types. The age ranges from ancient Precambrian (2 billion +), to the sands dunes still creeping across today's desert landscape. Every system of the well-known geologic column is represented, some almost completely. Each system also contains diagnostic fossils and distinctive rock types, which few other states can claim.</p><p></p><h2>Wishes, Lies and Dreams</h2><p>This item condition is New.

Drawing on the best biblical and historical scholarship, respected New Testament scholar Luke Timothy Johnson demonstrates that the "real Jesus" is the one experienced in the present through faith rather than the one found in speculative historical reconstructions.

(James D. G. Dunn, University of Durham) </p><p>"Hurrah! At a time when confusion abounds about who the 'real Jesus' is, Johnson sounds a clarion note: the 'real Jesus' is not the reconstructed Jesus of scholarship become unself-critical, but the Jesus who confronts persons in the texts of the New Testament as the resurrected Lord.

But for some people, getting a bad night's sleep isn't just an inconvenience: it's a nightmare. In <i>Sleepyhead</i>, science writer Henry Nicholls uses his own experience with chronic narcolepsy as a gateway to better understanding the cryptic, curious, and relatively uncharted world of sleep disorders. We meet insomniacs who can't get any sleep, narcoleptics who can't control when they sleep, and sleep apnea victims who nearly suffocate in their sleep. We learn the underlying difference between morning larks and night owls; why our sleeping habits shift as we grow older; and the evolutionary significance of REM sleep and dreaming. Charming, eye-opening, and deeply humanizing, <i>Sleepyhead</i> will help us all uncover the secrets of a good night's sleep.</p><p><b>Henry Nicholls</b> is a renowned science writer and author of three books.

Twenty-five of her twenty-seven crewmen were massacred, their heads &#34;arranged in a line&#34; for survivor John R Jewitt to identify. Jewitt and another survivor, John Thompson, became two of some fifty slaves owned by Chief Maquinna. Among other duties, they were forced to carry wood for three miles and fight for Maquinna when he slaughtered a neighbouring tribe. But their worst fear was the realization that slaves could be killed whenever their master chose. Since most of the Nootka wanted the two whites dead, they never knew what would come first- freedom or death. After Jewitt was rescued, he wrote a book of his experiences. It appeared in 1815 and became known as Jewitt&#39;s Narrative. It proved to be so popular that over 185 years later it is still being reprinted. This is a modernized edition publised in B.C., the land where Jewitt spent 28 months in slavery.</p><p><p>Born on May 21, 1783, <b>John Rodgers Jewitt</b> was the son of Edward Jewitt, a blacksmith in Lincolnshire, England, who wanted his son to further his education and become a surgeon. When his father moved his business to the seaport of Hull, John heard the call of the sea and signed on as the armourer on the Boston, an American sailing ship that left England and rounded Cape Horn for what was then called Vancouvers Island.</p> <p>John began his journal on June 1 using ink he made by boiling and filtering plant and berry juices with powdered coal. He entered the historical record with his memoirs about the 28 months he spent as a captive of Maquinna of the Nuu-chah-nulth people on the Pacific coast of what is now Canada. His memoir is a major source of written information about the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Although he had an Aboriginal wife at Nootka, John married Hester Jones on Christmas Day, 1809. John Jewitt died January 7, 1821, in Hartford, Connecticut. </p></p><h2>The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe Official Illustrated Movie Companion</h2><p>The ultimate visual companion and keepsake to the making of the stunning fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe based on the beloved children&#x2019;s classic by C.S.

Widowed and childless in 1861, Pember took the post of matron at the Confederate Army&#39;s Chimborazo Hospital in Richmond, Virginia. She labored there throughout the war and in 1879 chronicled her experiences in A Southern Woman&#39;s Story. Pember was honored by Confederate veterans&#39; organizations in her later years, and in 1995 her portrait appeared on a U.S. Postal Service Civil War commemorative stamp.This volume launches the press's new "American Civil War Classics" series. First published in 1879, the book recalls Pember's years as a matron at the Confederate Chimborazo Hospital in Richmond, VA, from 1862 to the city's fall in 1865. Pember, the daughter of a Jewish merchant and a staunch supporter of the Confederacy, here offers a firsthand account of life inside a hospital during the conflict. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Created To Be God&#39;s Friend: How God Shapes Those He Loves</h2><p><p>God called Abraham to be His friend. Henry Blackaby uses the example set by Abraham to show how God uses difficult events, traumatic circumstances, and trying life experiences to lead us to spiritual maturity. Readers will learn how God interacts with His people to transform them into men and women He can call friends. From the first time we respond to Gods Spirit in our lives through the choices that help us develop a worthy character, Abrahams story shows us how we can be transformed and become friends of God.</p></p><p><b>Henry Blackaby</b> is the author of over a dozen books, including the best-selling <i>Experiencing God</i> Bible studies. Dr. Blackaby is a graduate of the University of British Columbia. He has a Th.M. degree from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, has received four honorary doctorate degrees, and is the president of Henry Blackaby Ministries. Dr. Blackaby and his wife have five married children, all serving in Christian ministry. They are blessed with fourteen grandchildren.Blackaby, the Baptist minister who wrote the bestseller Experiencing God (1998), has crafted a serious, meaty argument that God wants His people to become His lifelong and dearly beloved friends. The way to do that, says Blackaby, is to emulate Abraham's response to God. Abraham practiced immediate obedience, even if he didn't understand the full picture of God's plan. Blackaby explains that obedience brings a fuller depth of knowledge of God, not only to the one called to be obedient but to his or her immediate family. Blackaby also uses Abraham's times of disobedience to show the tragic consequences when would-be followers take matters into their own hands. The author argues that disobedience can affect future generations, as when Abraham chose to sire a son with his wife's handmaiden, Hagar (rather than wait for God to fulfill his promise through his wife, Sarai), or when he passed Sarai off as his sister to the Pharaoh Abimelech. Blackaby maintains that God can still be gracious even while demonstrating consequences. Faith, in his opinion, is more than just a verbal statement--it is mindful obedience to God's voice. Each chapter closes with excellent questions for study and response. <p></p><p>Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Corinthian: Gossip, scandal and an unforgettable Regency romance</h2><p>The only question which hangs over the life of Sir Richard Wyndham, notable whip, dandy and Corinthian, is one of marriage.

It has been quoted by popes, presidents, prime ministers, and revolutionaries around the world. From "Four score and seven years ago..." to "government of the people, by the people, for the people," Lincoln's words echo in the American conscience. Many books have been written about the Gettysburg Address and yet, as Lincoln scholar Gabor Boritt shows, there is much that we don't know about the speech. In <i>The Gettysburg Gospel</i> he reconstructs what really happened in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on November 19, 1863. Boritt tears away a century of myths, lies, and legends to give us a clear understanding of the greatest American's greatest speech.<p>In the aftermath of the bloodiest battle ever fought in North America, the little town of Gettysburg was engulfed in the worst man-made disaster in U.S. history: close to 21,000 wounded; very few doctors; heroic women coping in houses, barns, and churches turned into hospitals; dead horses and mules rotting in farmyards and fields; and at least 7,000 dead soldiers who had to be dug up, identified, and reburied. This was where Lincoln had to come to explain why the horror of war must continue.</p><p>Planning America's first national cemetery revitalized the traumatized people of Gettysburg, but the dedication ceremonies overwhelmed the town. Lincoln was not certain until the last moment whether he could come. But he knew the significance of the occasion and wrote his remarks with care -- the first speech since his inauguration that he prepared before delivering it. A careful analysis of the Address and the public reaction to it form the center of this book. Boritt shows how Lincoln responded to the politics of the time and also clarifies which text he spoke from and how and when he wrote the various versions. Few people initially recognized the importance of the speech; it was frequently and, at times, hilariously misreported. But over the years the speech would grow into American scripture. It would acquire new and broader meanings. It would be better understood, but also misunderstood and misinterpreted to suit beliefs very different from Lincoln's.</p><p><i>The Gettysburg Gospel</i> is based on years of scholarship as well as a deep understanding of Lincoln and of Gettysburg itself. It draws on vital documents essential to appreciating Lincoln's great speech and its evolution into American gospel. This is an indispensable book for anyone interested in the Gettysburg Address, Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War, or American history.</p></p><p>Gabor Boritt is director of the Civil War Institute and the Fluhrer Professor of Civil War Studies at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.At Gettysburg, the stench of the unburied dead, masses of uncontrolled crowds, and sprees of drunken revelry preceded the Great Emancipators dedication of that hallowed ground. The author portrays the milieu of Gettysburg in November of 1863, following the great battle. Michael Kramer matches his narration to the mood of the event--somber, respectful, and measured. He alters his voice for some of the quotations without any awkwardness. While he doesnt attempt to create a character specific to Lincoln, he handles the presidents folksiness and oratory equally well. After hearing the authors analysis of the intricacies of Lincolns address, listeners finally get to hear the Kramers rendition of the most famous speech in American history--delivered, surprisingly, as if by a detached bystander.

As every first-year teacher knows, a classroom full of second graders can be alarmingly unpredictable. <br><br> The letters the children write to Mrs. Hartwell are sympathetic ("I figured you might be a little scared, just like me"); informative ("...most kids don't eat cauliflower"); encouraging ("Yesterday was THE BEST!"); and apologetic ("I'm sorry about throwing up all over your shoes").

She lives in Denver, Colorado.K-Gr. 3. There are lots of humor and probably a little truth in this hilarious account of a new teacher's first year, which is relayed in a series of classroom letters. On September ninth, Shannon, who has noticed Mrs. Hartwell's hand shaking when she puts her name on the blackboard, writes to her teacher, "that's when I figured you might be a little scared, just like me." Missives in generic type are interspersed with handwritten letters from Josh, a student whose spelling and handwriting noticeably improve throughout the year. Especially funny are students' observations about the principal: "When Mrs. Burton came into our class today, your face turned really red. I peeked to see what she was writing. I couldn't read a word! Did you know Mrs. Burton has very messy handwriting?" The funny illustrations show the class in glorious chaos, from dealing with an escaped class pet snake to the disarray after knocking over of a stuffed bison during a field trip to a natural history museum. Kids and teachers alike will appreciate this unusual take on the ups and downs of a school year. <i>Diane Foote</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Late in the game, commentator Tony Kubek asked Joe Garagiola, "Did you ever see anybody throw faster than Nolan Ryan?"<br>Without hesitating, Joe replied, "Sure. Rex Barney."<br>Joe Garagiola contributes the foreword for this story of Rex Barney, the man who threw faster than Feller, faster than Ryan; whose pitching career sped by quicker than his fastball because he could not control it.

Two months after Leo's departure, Barney no-hit the Giants in the Polo Grounds.<br>In his own inimitable style, Rex tells the story of his battle to control his fastball and, later, his own life, and his struggles to overcome illness and a near-fatal stroke.

This shield of faith is one of the main ways we can resist our enemy's attacks. We are fully capable of resisting the enemy's attacks, but we must first be able to recognize how Satan fights. His main weapons are to create fear and doubt in us and to tempt us to become complainers and murmurers. If we succumb, our faith is weakened.

After the overthrow of the brutal Huerta, Venustiano Carranza came to the forefront, but his provisional government was opposed by Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, who come powefully to life in Alan Knight's book. Knight offers a fresh interpretation of the great schism of 1914-15, which divided the revolution in its moment of victory, and which led to the final bout of civil war between the forces of Villa and Carranza. By the end of this brilliant study of a popular uprising that deteriorated into political self-seeking and vengeance, nearly all the leading players have been assassinated.

LANSDALE</b> is the author of more than three dozen novels, including<i> Paradise Sky</i>, the Edgar Award-winning <i>The Bottoms</i>, <i>Sunset</i> and <i>Sawdust</i>, and <i>Leather Maiden</i>. He has received eleven Bram Stoker Awards, the American Mystery Award, the British Fantasy Award, the Raymond Chandler Award, and the Grinzane Cavour Prize for Literature. He lives with his family in Nacogdoches, Texas."Listening to a Joe R. Lansdale's East Texas detective yarn in the Hap Collins-and-Leonard Pine series is like hanging out with a skilled barroom raconteur. Lansdale's language dances with colorful and regular profanity as he performs a shotgun wedding between wild and ridiculous, tying it together with enough cartoonish violence and abundant wit to send you reaching for your wallet to buy the next round. . . . Altogether it's wild, funny, utterly improbable and thoroughly satisfying entertainment."&#x2015;<b>Jenni Laidman</b>, <b><i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br>"Audacious . . . <i>Honky Tonk Samurai</i> lives up to the rich legacy of the titles that preceded it in Lansdale's Hap and Leonard series. . . . It takes a masterful writer to pull off what Lansdale accomplishes in these books, combining humor, nihilism and absurdism along with sublime plotting and character development. It reads as if it's done effortlessly, and that's no small trick."&#x2015;<b>W.K. Stratton</b>, <b><i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><br><br>"Terrific . . . This shambolic, action-packed novel will ensnare new readers and satisfy devoted fans alike.

Lansdale's perpetual bad boys, Hap Collins and Leonard Pine.... a ton of fun."&#x2015;<b><i><i>New York Times</i></i></b><br><br>"The camaraderie and down-home scatology carry the day. Let's hope there's more of that good feeling to come in this terrific series."&#x2015;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews (starred)</i></b><br><br>"Another jawdropper from the seemingly indefatigable favorite son of Nacogdoches, Texas . . . Hilarious, crude and violent, peppered through and through with unforgettable characters that leap off the page, dance around the room, and run off down the road. It doesn't get any better than this. . . .

But when he ends up all alone on the open water as a storm is rolling in, it&#x2019;s up to him to save a stuck ocean liner. This classic story is sure to delight a whole new generation of readers!</p><p>Hardie Gramatky was born in Dallas, TX, in 1907 but moved to California as a small boy after his father died of tuberculosis. He attended Stanford University (earning the tuition by working as a logger and a bank teller) and Chouinard Art Institute before becoming one of Disney&#x2019;s early animators in 1929. In the 1920s and `30s, he helped start the California Watercolor movement. In 1936, after a 6-year Disney contract expired, he left the company (earning $150 a week, a huge sum in the Depression) to move to New York City with his wife, artist Dorothea Cooke, to become illustrators. It was there, in his studio on Pearl Street, that Gramatky saw a Moran tugboat out his window that obviously didn&#x2019;t want to work and kept making figure 8s on the East River. So in 1939 after painting many watercolors of the busy harbor, Gramatky wondered what would happen if a &#x201c;tug didn&#x2019;t want to tug&#x201d; and wrote the story. The book got immediate attention and has been a favorite picture book ever since, and Gramatky&#x2019;s fine art watercolors and gicl�e prints continue to be prized. He died of cancer of the ileum in Westport, Connecticut, on April 29, 1979.<b>Praise for <i>Little Toot</i> by Hardie Gramatky:</b><br><br>"I am delighted to know that this classic piece of Americana, <i>Little Toot</i>, will be enjoyed by readers of all ages for many years to come."--Eric Carle<br><br>"How delightful to revisit the seaworthy world of brave Little Toot--that little tugboat who proves his courage and earns his manhood riding atop Gramatky's superb, water, wild waves.

Cleon Skousen was a world renowned teacher, lecturer and scholar for more than 60 years. Born in Raymond, Alberta, Canada on January 20, 1913, Dr. Skousen s growing up years were spent in Canada, Mexico, and California.</p><p>He attended college at the San Bernardino Junior College where he was elected Student Body President.</p><p>In 1934 he went to law school at George Washington University in Washington DC, where he earned his Juris Doctorate and was admitted to practice law in the District of Columbia. At this same time he was employed with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p><p>Dr. Skousen married Jewel Pitcher of San Bernardino, California, in August 1936. During their 69 years of marriage, they raised eight children and became the grandparents of 50 grandchildren and more than 90 great-grandchildren.</p><p>Dr. Skousen served the FBI for 16 years (1935-1951), and worked closely with J. Edgar Hoover including a hot-spot stint as the director of communications. As a prolific writer and speaker, he wrote his national best seller, The Naked Communist and later became the editor of the nation s leading police magazine, Law And Order. In 1960 he began a speaking tour around the country addressing the important political issues facing America at that time. During this period, he averaged 300 speeches a year.</p><p>In 1972 Dr. Skousen organized a non-profit educational foundation named The Freemen Institute. Later changed to The National Center for Constitutional Studies (NCCS), Dr. Skousen and his staff became the nation s leading organization in teaching students and legislators seminars on the Founding Fathers and the U.S. Constitution. His books The Making of America and The 5,000 Year Leap have been used nation-wide to educate students on the original intent of the Founding Fathers.</p><p>His many books and recordings addressed diverse subjects ranging from the raising of boys, to the principles of good government, to prophetic history. Dr. Skousen accumulated a wealth of knowledge and optimism information that he called the diamond dust of exciting history, natural law and eternal principles of hope. These principles he painstakingly distilled into the pages of over 40 books and pamphlets, to be shared in an exciting and inspirational manner. This is what made him so popular with audiences of millions around the world.</p>I beg you to read this book filled with words of wisdom which I can only describe as divinely inspired.

What they have to say will surprise Americans, just as they surprised the women themselves. Not since Marcel Ophuls&#39; controversial film The Sorrow and the Pity have we been on such intimate terms with &#34;the enemy.&#34;</p><p>Alison Owings is a freelance journalist who has contributed regularly major television network news broadcasts. She is author of<i> Indian Voices: Listening to Native Americans </i>(Rutgers University Press, 2011)<i> and Hey, Waitress!: The USA from the Other Side of the Tray.. </i>She lives in the San Francisco Bay area with her husband."A remarkable work of history that stands out from the vast library of World War II studies for its sheer intimacy and its sometimes startling perspectives... Frauen transcends the genre of oral history and turns into something more elaborate and accomplished and memorable." - Los Angeles Times Book Review -- <i>(Los Angeles Times Book Review)</i><br><br>"An engaging book... this is oral history as it should be done." -- <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"In vivid and often poignant portraits-cum-interviews of 29 {German} women in their 70's and older, {Ms. Owings} has captured the extraordinary diversity of their experiences. They had in common that they were caught up in a political system and a war designed by men. Unlike many fathers, husbands and brothers, they also survived the war. But in the end, their memories form no single image. . . . In their different ways, . . . each portrait, each interview, provides a valuable insight into what happened to half the German population between 1933 and 1945. Yet in the end the book seems to suggest that Germany's women reacted little differently from its men." -- <i>Alan Riding - The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Owings, a freelance television writer who is neither a German nor a Jew, has compiled and edited a groundbreaking set of oral histories. She interviews women from many spectrums of the Third Reich: Germans, Jews, individuals of ``mixed'' parentage, a countess, a camp guard, women who hid Jews, Nazi supporters, Communists, and other women who witnessed and participated in everyday and extraordinary events. Owings has tried, as much as possible, to quote her interviewees directly yet still manages to create an even and engaging text. This volume is an excellent companion to Claudia Koonz's <i>Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, Family Life, and Nazi Ideology</i> , 1919-1945 ( LJ 11/1/86). Highly recommended." -- <i>Jenny Presnell, Miami Univ. Libs., Oxford, Ohio</i><br><br>"This is at times a strangely funny book, telling of human foibles. But at all times, it's a cautionary tale. It could happen here, to women as well as men. A revelatory and exciting book." -- <i>Studs Terkel - author of RACE</i><br><br>"This} is an extraordinarily rich historical source, both exhilarating and exasperating, moving and, occasionally, hilarious. Owings asks tough questions, has a fine eye for telling gestures, and chooses her subjects from all walks of life. . . . The women's responses to probings about the Holocaust, membership in the {Nazi} party or its auxiliary organizations, and treatment at the hands of the Russians and Americans are full of surprises. Unregenerate anti-Semites, self-effacing heroines of the resistance, and everything in between make their appearances in lengthy, sometimes multiple, sessions. This book enriches readers' understanding of what it was like to be alive in Hitler's Germany and how some Germans have come to terms with their past. An excellent work." --<i>R.S. Levy - Choice</i></p><h2>Theology of Liberation</h2><p>This is the credo and seminal text of the movement which was later characterized as liberation theology. The book burst upon the scene in the early seventies, and was swiftly acknowledged as a pioneering and prophetic approach to theology which famously made an option for the poor, placing the exploited, the alienated, and the economically wretched at the centre of a programme where &#34;the oppressed and maimed and blind and lame&#34; were prioritized at the expense of those who either maintained the status quo or who abused the structures of power for their own ends. This powerful, compassionate and radical book attracted criticism for daring to mix politics and religion in so explicit a manner, but was also welcomed by those who had the capacity to see that its agenda was nothing more nor less than to give &#34;good news to the poor&#34;, and redeem God&#39;s people from bondage.</p><p>Gustavo Guti rrez, a Dominican theologian from Peru, is widely recognized as one of the preeminent voices of liberation theology.

The company began with one family-run root beer stand and grew over eight decades, through his leadership, into a global corporation that is widely respected for the business it does and the way it does business. In 1964, on the eve of being named president of the company, Marriott&#x2019;s father, founder and then-CEO J. Willard Marriott, Sr., tucked a letter in his 32-year-old son&#x2019;s desk drawer. The letter contained insights and guideposts that proved invaluable as Bill Jr., blazed the trail not only for his company, but for the hospitality industry as well. The letter, printed in this book, provides timeless advice for any person in any business who aims to achieve success. <i>Without Reservations</i> is a compilation of engaging stories that takes the reader behind the scenes as events and decisions unfold.</p><p><b>J.W. &#x201c;Bill&#x201d; Marriott</b>, Jr., became executive chairman of Marriott International, Inc., in 2012 after being the company&#x2019;s chief executive for forty years. He is an American business icon who has successfully created a multi-billion-dollar global hotel company. He divides his time between the Washington, DC, area and New Hampshire with his wife, Donna. They have four children, fifteen grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.It's rare that someone like Bill Marriott comes along--his singular leadership has shaped the culture and the astounding success of a company of 300,000 people. Without Reservations reveals the enduring secrets of his incomparable leadership--a must read for anyone aspiring to build an enterprise, to lead or to succeed. --W. Mitt Romney, Former Massachusetts Governor and Bain Financial Founder<br><br>Bill Marriott is one of the best entrepreneurial minds in the business. He knows what it takes to build brands, relationships and a winning corporate culture. Without Reservations is a compelling story of how best-in-class service, integrity, loyalty and leadership turned a small, family business into one of the world s most respected companies. --Ken Chenault, CEO and Chairman, American Express<br><br>As our world grows more interdependent with each passing day, the most profitable companies will be those that find ways to benefit society as a whole within the framework of their business models. Bill Marriott knew this long before the dawn of the 21st century, and his results speak for themselves he has built an enormously successful global corporation on the idea that businesses should be responsible members of their communities, and that all people deserve respect and the opportunity to thrive. --Former President Bill Clinton</p><h2>Wheels Within Wheels</h2><p>Any conventional account of the life Edward Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, would tell of his passion for motorcars, his setting up of the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu in Hampshire, his accession to the Montagu barony at the age of three (his father had been a pioneer motorist and Conservative MP), his attendance at the House of Lords for more than fifty years), and his Chairmanship of English Heritage. But his Who&#x2019;s Who entry makes no mention of an event in his life in the mid-1950s that was instrumental in a reform of the law on homosexuality. <p>In WHEELS UPON WHEELS Montagu reveals for the first time what happened in 1952 when he was arrested &#x2013; along with the journalist Peter Wildeblood (died in 1999) &#x2013; on charges that lead to his trial and ultimate imprisonment. Montagu discusses for the very first time with frankness - and humour - his own sexuality, how he first realised his own sexual preferences were &#x2018;ambidextrous&#x2019; and how he used his position as a Peer to campaign for a royal commission &#x2013; eventually set up by Harold Macmillan under Lord Wolfenden - that led to the law being changed.</p><p>These memoirs benefit from the memories and diaries kept by his mother, who only died, aged 101, in 1986. He has also unearthed a trunk of papers relating to his trial, which he had not looked at for more than 40 years. </p><p>WHEELS UPON WHEELS will prove to be the most sensational memoirs of their year.</p></p><p>As above.A leading English peer, voted in at number 27 of the 42 who survived the chop on 5 November last year, reveals all in his memoirs. Having been imprisoned in the early Fifties for allegedly improper sexual relations, the author here denies the criminality of his actions. Indeed the law was reformed as a result of the campaign by Peter Wildeblood, one of the other men involved. Lord Montagu spares us the intimate details, concentrating on his life story as a member of the aristocracy, from his childhood and family home, to his involvement serving in Palestine in World War II and his undergraduate days in Oxford. This period is followed by more detailed accounts of his fight for the &#34;national heritage&#34;, the upkeep of the Beaulieu estate and motor museum and his career in the House of Lords. An old-fashioned view of English life, with references to an awe-inspiring cast of acquaintances from the Fifties jet-set.</p><h2>Each Moment Is the Universe: Zen and the Way of Being Time</h2><p>It&#x2019;s easy to regard time as a commodity&#x2014;we even speak of &#x201c;saving&#x201d; or &#x201c;spending&#x201d; it. We often regard it as an enemy, when we feel it slipping away before we&#x2019;re ready for time to be up. The Zen view of time is radically different than that: time is not something separate from our life; rather, our life <i>is</i> time. Understand this, says Dainin Katagiri Roshi, and you can live fully and freely right where you are in each moment.&nbsp; <br><br>Katagiri bases his teaching on <i>Being Time</i>, a text by the most famous of all Zen masters, Eihei Dogen (1200&#x2013;1253), to show that time is a creative, dynamic process that continuously produces the universe and everything in it&#x2014;and that to understand this is to discover a gateway to freedom from the dissatisfactions of everyday life. He guides us in contemplating impermanence, the present moment, and the ungraspable nature of past and future. He discusses time as part of our inner being, made manifest through constant change in ourselves and our surroundings. And these ideas are by no means metaphysical abstractions: they can be directly perceived by any of us through meditation.</p><p>Born in Osaka, Japan, in 1928, Dainin Katagiri was trained traditionally as a Zen teacher. He first came to the United States in 1963, to help with a Soto Zen Temple in Los Angeles. He later joined Shunryu Suzuki Roshi at the San Francisco Zen Center and taught there until Suzuki Roshi&#x2019;s death in 1971. He was then invited to form a new Zen center in Minneapolis, which, in addition to a monastery in the countryside of Minnesota, he oversaw until his death in 1990. He left behind a legacy of recorded teachings and twelve Dharma heirs. Katagiri is the author of several books, including <i>Returning to Silence</i> and <i>You Have to Say Something.</i>"Move over, Martin Heidegger. The late Japanese Zen master Katagiri Roshi offers a Zen interpretation of being and time. . . . Katagiri conveys a zest for Zen understanding that differs from the calm inscrutability of other Zen Buddhists."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) <br><br>&#x201c;In this book, Katagiri Roshi presents Dogen Zenji&#x2019;s teachings on &#x2018;being-time&#x2019; and teaches how the blossom of our life force can flourish amidst the flow of change. I recommend this book to all Zen practitioners and to anyone who wishes to enrich and ripen their life.&#x201d;&#x2014;Shohaku Okumura Roshi, Director, Soto Zen Buddhism International Center<br> <br>&#x201c;By showing how to cultivate awareness of the changing moment, Katagiri Roshi leads us toward timeless time, the absolute nature. This book is a spring of nectar for new and seasoned practitioners alike.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tulku Thondup, author of <i>Peaceful Death, Joyful Rebirth</i> <br><br>&#x201c;These are brilliant and lucid reflections on the immense significance of the present moment. These liberating teachings by Katagiri Roshi are unique and precious in their ability to help us learn to use time skillfully&#x2014;and not to be used by it. A major contribution for all schools of meditation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Larry Rosenberg, founder of the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center and author of <i>Breath by Breath</i> and <i>Living in the</i> <i> Light of Death</i> <br><br>&#x201c;This lively book presents the inner nature of true presence, beyond time and space, right within the time that includes all times. In the Zen art of being time finely portrayed herein, multidirectional sense of temporality is pivotal to the dynamic expression of our humanity and wholeness.&#x201d;&#x2014;Dan Leighton, author of <i>Visions of Awakening Space</i> <i>and Time: Dogen and the Lotus Sutra</i></p><h2>Faded Footprints: The Lost Rhoades Gold Mines &amp; Other Hidden Treasures of the Uintas</h2><p>New edition of George Thompson's classic work on Utah's most famous lost gold mine: The Lost Rhoades Mine.

Mark Whitacre, the promising golden boy of ADM, had put his career and family at risk to wear a wire and deceive his friends and colleagues. Using Whitacre and a small team of agents to tap into the secrets at ADM, the FBI discovered the company's scheme to steal millions of dollars from its own customers. <br><br>But as the FBI and federal prosecutors closed in on ADM, using stakeouts, wiretaps, and secret recordings of illegal meetings around the world, they suddenly found that everything was not all that it appeared. At the same time Whitacre was cooperating with the Feds while playing the role of loyal company man, he had his own<br>agenda he kept hidden from everyone around him--his wife, his lawyer, even the FBI agents who had come to trust him with the case they had put their careers on the line for. Whitacre became sucked into his own world of James Bond antics, imperiling the criminal case and creating a web of deceit that left the FBI and prosecutors uncertain where the lies stopped and the truth began.<br><br>In this gripping account unfolds one of the most captivating and bizarre tales in the history of the FBI and corporate America. Meticulously researched and richly told by New York Times senior writer Kurt Eichenwald, <b>The Informant</b> re-creates the drama of the story, beginning with the secret recordings, stakeouts, and interviews with suspects and witnesses to the power struggles within ADM and its board--including the high-profile chairman Dwayne Andreas, F. Ross Johnson, and Brian Mulroney--to the big-gun Washington lawyers hired by ADM and on up through the ranks of the Justice Department to FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno.<br><br>A page-turning real-life thriller that features deadpan FBI agents, crooked executives, idealistic lawyers, and shady witnesses with an addiction to intrigue, <b>The Informant</b> tells an important and compelling story of power and betrayal in America</p><p><i>"The FBI was ready to take down America's most politically powerful corporation. But there was one thing they didn't count on."</i><p> So reads the cover of this high-powered true crime story, an accurate teaser to a bizarre financial scandal with more plot twists than a John Grisham novel. In 1992 the FBI stumbled upon Mark Whitacre, a top executive at the Archer Daniels Midland corporation who was willing to act as a government witness to a vast international price-fixing conspiracy. ADM, which advertises itself as "The Supermarket to the World," processes grains and other farm staples into oils, flours, and fibers for products that fill America's shelves, from Jell-O pudding to StarKist tuna. The company's chairman and chief executive, Dwayne Andreas, was so influential that he introduced Ronald Reagan to Mikhail Gorbachev, and it was his maneuvering that ensured that high fructose corn syrup would replace sugar in most foods (ever wondered why Coke and Pepsi don't taste quite like they used to?). There were two mottoes at ADM: "The competitors are our friends, and the customers are our enemies" and "We know when we're lying." And lie they did. With the help of Whitacre, the FBI made hundreds of tapes and videos of ADM executives making price-fixing deals with their corrivals from Japan, Korea, and Canada, all while drinking coffee and laughing about their crimes. The tapes should have cinched the case, but there was one problem: Their star witness was manipulative, deceitful, and unstable. Nothing was as it seemed, and the investigation into one of the most astounding white-collar crime cases in history had only just begun.</p><p> Kurt Eichenwald, an investigative reporter, covered the story for <i>The New York Times</i> and interviewed more than 100 participants in the case. He methodically records the six-year investigation, leaving no plot twist or tape transcript unexplored. While his primary focus is on deconstructing the disturbed Whitacre and revealing the malleability of truth, the portrait of ADM (and even the Justice Department) is damning enough to make anyone a cynic. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>"The Informant is epic in scope, a tale of human foibles--of greed, deceit, and arrogance--and also of the search for truth. Eichenwald has told it masterfully, with the narrative drive of a novel. I guarantee it'll keep you reading late into the night."<br>-- Jonathan Harr, A Civil Action<br><br>"The Informant is superb reporting in the service of a great story, one with the drama and suspense of a Le Carr� novel. Set squarely in the American heartland, delving into the inner sanctum of a global corporation, it explores the shifting boundaries of truth and deception, loyalty and betrayal. It is a remarkable achievement."<br>-- James B. Stewart, Den of Thieves and Blind Eye<br><br>"The twists and turns of this nonfiction work leave many thrillers in the dust. Eichenwald's spare prose and journalistic eye for detail make the pages fly."<br>-- David Baldacci, Absolute Power and Saving Faith<br><br>"I would say The Informant reads like Grisham, only nobody ever could have invented these characters. A tale this riveting and this strange could only have been built from truth."<br>-- Sherry Sontag, coauthor, Blind Man's Bluff<br></p><h2>The Great Fire of London 350th Anniversary</h2><p><p>In 1666, London's citizens woke to see the skyline above their city's cramped wooden houses ablaze. <i>The Great Fire of London </i>is a hauntingly beautiful visual re-telling of one of the most well-known disasters in the city's history.

While the stories are as unique and vibrant as the individual celebrities who tell them, the irrefutable collective message is that addiction knows no boundaries. The disease strikes and topples even those who are seemingly on top of the world. Still, The Harder They Fall is a book of hope. In this modern-day version of the 1980s New York Times best-seller The Courage to Change, the famous people profiled have climbed out from the devastation of addiction to lead lives of extraordinary accomplishment.</p><p>Gary Stromberg in 1967 cofounded one of the most successful public relations firms in the entertainment business and represented music industry superstars including The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Barbra Streisand, Elton John, The Doors, and Earth Wind and Fire. He coproduced the motion pictures Car Wash and The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh. He currently manages artists through The Blackbird Group.The celebrities interviewed here--from Ann Lamott to Alice Cooper--are all in recovery from addictions to alcohol or drugs that originated in the 1960s and '70s. Among them are athletes, musicians, actors and even a member of Congress, Jim Ramstad. With the assistance of veteran writer Merrill, Stromberg, who ran a P.R. firm for musicians and produced films (<i>Car Wash</i>), provides a brief introduction to each subject before eliciting his or her first-person story. Stromberg, a former abuser of heroin, cocaine and alcohol, also shares his spectacular success in the 1970s and his equally dramatic drug-addled fall in 1980, when he lost his home, lover and career. Like many of those he interviewed, he became sober through traditional rehab and recovery programs. But Pete Hamill found his path to sobriety alone by deciding "to live my life without anesthesia, and that meant accepting the pain along with the laughs." Top jockey Pat Day describes how he was saved from drug and alcohol dependence through a commitment to born-again Christianity. The strength of these always honest and affecting anecdotes is, in fact, their variety of paths to recovery; the diversity should help this excellent volume appeal to a wide audience. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(St. James Guide to Writers Series)</h2><p><p>This exciting new guide to historic and contemporary horror, ghost and gothic writers features the men and women who've kept readers turning pages into the wee hours of the night. Your patrons with a penchant for this genre will find all the details they need to answer their questions on 450 authors. </p><p>Author entries feature a biography; a complete list of the author's publications; selected critical and biographical works; and comments by the entrant, when available. A critical essay written by an expert in the field helps readers better understand the author and his or her works. </p><p>Coverage includes these authors: </p><ul> <li>Clive Barker </li><li>Stephen Vincent Benet </li><li>Mary Higgins Clark </li><li>Douglass Clegg </li><li>Isak Dinesen </li><li>Nathaniel Hawthorne </li><li>Shirley Jackson </li><li>Doris Lessing </li><li>H.P.

A comprehensive reading list helps your patrons find reference and critical sources to continue their research.</p><p>In his preface to this encyclopedic reference, Dennis Etchison is typically eloquent in defending horror literature, the power of which "derives from its predilection for addressing the fundamental questions of life and death, the drama that does not need to be melodramatized.... The problem is that this requires a greater degree of attention to style, mood and the connotative aspects of language than is found in most fiction, and that the better you do your job the more the reader is likely to expect an extraordinary payoff at the end--something larger, deeper, and truer, justifying the trust that has been extended to you. In that respect a fine horror story may well be the most difficult of writing extant, excepting poetry. Because it is about the Great Truth, it ultimately calls for nothing less than <i>authentic knowledge</i>, or at least an intimation of it, the kind of understanding of one's characters and their problems that can only come from personal insight. This is something that is not easy to fake."<p> Etchison's remarks may pertain but indirectly to the quality of the <i>St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost, &amp; Gothic Writers</i> as a reference, but they're worth quoting to illustrate the earnest intent behind this volume. The sense of horror being valued for what it attempts as well as for what it achieves is present on every page. </p><p> The format of this huge reference is similar to that of the other St. James Guides: each of the more than 425 entries (mostly English-language authors, with a couple dozen who write in other languages) contains a brief biography, a complete list of works (divided into horror and nonhorror titles), and a signed critical essay. The A to Z entries fill nearly 700 double-column oversized pages--a <i>lot</i> of useful information. Also included are three indices (name, nationality, title) and a reading list of nonfiction writing about horror, ghost, and gothic literature.</p><p> The editors intend this as a companion volume to the <i>St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers</i>. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>This companion to the <i>St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers</i> [RBB My 1 96] includes more than 400 writers in English and 25 foreign-language writers. In the first volume, the editor explained how difficult it is to separate horror and fantasy since much fantasy contains horrific elements and much horror relies on the fantastic, so these two volumes were necessary. The kinds of fiction covered here are "horror novels, dark fantasies, ghost stories, gothic novels, tales of terror, supernatural fictions, occult fantasies, black-magic stories, psychological thrillers, tales of unease, <i>grand-guignol </i>shockers, creepy stories, shudder-pulp fictions, <i>contes cruels,</i> uncanny stories, macabre fictions and weird tales." A few children's writers, such as Christopher Pike and R. L. Stine, are included. Only a small number of authors, among them Joan Aiken, Robert Holdstock, Fritz Leiber, and Fred Saberhagen, appear in the fantasy volume as well.<p>The format is the same one followed in most of the St. James guides: an alphabetical list of authors, a summary of biographical information, an extensive bibliography of works (primarily related to the genre, but other works are listed as well), a list of some secondary sources, and a critical analysis of the works and how they fit within the genre. The critical sections are signed by the contributors, whose credentials are provided in the back of the book. The work contains a name index with cross-references to the pseudonyms if applicable, a nationality index, a title index, and a very lengthy reading list.</p><p>The names one might expect are in here, including William Peter Blatty, Robin Cook, Stephen King, Ann Radcliffe, and Bram Stoker. But other writers who are not so closely associated with the genre, such as Charles Dickens and Walter Scott, are included as well. Writers one might encounter in a literature class, such as Shirley Jackson, Eudora Welty, and Edith Wharton, are also covered.</p><p>The high quality, consistency of approach, and large number of authors covered make this an excellent addition to the literary reference section. Although many of these writers can be found in sources such as Gale's <i>Contemporary Authors </i>or <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography</i>, the genre approach is very useful to students and teachers who are interested in horror, ghost stories, and gothic fiction. This title is needed to complete the set for libraries with the fantasy volume, and is a welcome addition to library collections needing general information on horror writers. <i></i></p></p><h2>Vegetable Love</h2><p>Barbara Kafka has been shaping the way America cooks for three decades. She&#x2019;s doing it again. <br><br>With her customary originality, thoroughness, and passion for great cooking, Barbara Kafka has created the cook&#x2019;s ultimate vegetable resource: 750 original recipes showcasing everything she adores about the vegetable world, from the lowly green bean to the exotic chrysanthemum leaf&#x2014;even stretching the definition to include potatoes, mushrooms, and avocados just because she&#x2019;s crazy mad for them. <br><br>Her love of vegetables shows in every dish, each impeccably researched, consistently foolproof, and put to the Kafka taste test. Among these delectable dishes are dozens of essays, including personal reflections on the garden and migrations in the vegetable world, for example; all are erudite and unfailingly entertaining. <br><br> Kafka&#x2019;s book within a book&#x2014;an at-a-glance, we&#x2019;ve-done-all-the-work-for-you Cook&#x2019;s Guide&#x2014;provides practical, encyclopedic information on how to buy, measure, substitute, and prepare every food that ever called itself a vegetable.</p><p>Barbara Kafka, inveterate food professional and cookbook writer, she of <i>Roasting: A Simple Art</i>, <i>Soup: A Way of Life</i>, and <i>Microwave Gourmet</i> among others, now brings us the last word on vegetables with the awe-inspiring and massive <i>Vegetable Love: A Book for Cooks</i>. This book has 200 pages dedicated simply to background information on vegetables--buying and storing, cutting, basic cooking techniques, yields and equivalences, etcetera. And then there are the recipes, all 750 of them! <p> She's a canny lass, Barbara Kafka, with as much respect for the culture of vegetables as for their preparation and cooking, and has divided <i>Vegetable Love</i> into four basic sections: Vegetables of the New World; Vegetables of the Mediterranean Basin, Europe, and the Arab World; Vegetables of Asia and Africa; and, Citizens of the World. For those inclined to think that vegetables come from supermarkets, Kafka takes you back to the roots, the origins, then revels in the ways in which these foods have found their way around the globe and into everyone's kitchen. Rhubarb, the pie plant of New England spring gardens, finds its beginnings in China and is as much at home in sweet pies as savory lamb stews. </p><p> You'll find recipes from all over the world in the New World section because that's the home of potatoes, green beans and their kin (Szechuan green beans anyone?), peppers, summer squash, certainly corn, but tomatoes and peanuts, too. Asparagus, beets, chard, carrots--those vegetable garden stalwarts--are found in the Euro/Arab section. Recipes are short, direct, to the point. Kafka minces no words. </p><p> But that's where the final sections come into play. One is Basic Recipes and Techniques, taking into account all manner of dressings, sauces, marinades, stocks, doughs, pastries, pastas, egg dishes, etcetera. And the other, that 200 page compendium, The Cook's Guide, fills in around the spare edges of the recipes. <i>Vegetable Love</i> is easily three books in one. </p><p> Barbara Kafka knows that when it comes to cooking for friends or family or oneself in this busy modern world, a recipe that is simple, brief, and to the point is like gold. With <i>Vegetable Love</i> Barbara Kafka delivers true wealth. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><p>Few have done more to define how Americans prepare food than Barbara Kafka, whose IACP and James Beard award-winning books <i>Roasting</i> and <i>Microwave Gourmet</i> made two underutilized techniques central to everyday cooking.

As the leader of fascinating, often dangerous expeditions all over the planet, he discovered firsthand the complexity and beauty of life on earth and undersea&#x2015;and watched the toll taken by human activity in the twentieth century. </p><p>In this magnificent last book, finally available for the first time in the United States, Cousteau describes his deeply informed philosophy about protecting our world for future generations. Weaving gripping stories of his adventures throughout, he and coauthor Susan Schiefelbein address the risks we take with human health, the overfishing and sacking of the world's oceans, the hazards of nuclear proliferation, and the environmental responsibility of scientists, politicians, and people of faith. Cousteau's lyrical, passionate call for action to protect our earth and seas and their myriad life forms is even more relevant today than when this book was completed in 1996. Written over the last ten years of his life with frequent collaborator Schiefelbein, who also introduces the text and provides an update on environmental developments in the decade since Cousteau's death, this prescient, clear-sighted book is a remarkable testament to the life and work of one of our greatest modern adventurers.</p></p><p><p><b>Jacques Cousteau</b> (1910&#x2013;1997) was world renowned as an ocean explorer, filmmaker, educator, and environmental activist. He won three Oscars and the Palme d'Or for his films<i>,</i> was nominated for forty Emmys during the run of his TV series <i>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau</i>, and wrote or coauthored more than seventy five books, including <i>The Silent World</i>, which has sold five million copies in twenty two languages. As director of the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco and a member of the advisory committee of the IAEA, he was active in the conservation and anti-nuclear-proliferation movements. <b>Susan Schiefelbein </b>has won the National Magazine Award and the Front Page Award for her cover stories on social issues. A former editor at the <i>Saturday Review</i>, where she first worked with Cousteau, she went on to write the narration for many of his documentary films, including winners of the Peabody and the Ace. She lives in Paris.</p>Jacques Cousteau was a legendary adventurer--and an environmental activist. In his memoir, Cousteau, a firm proponent of the planet's rights long before Al Gore came along, runs the gamut from expressing concern to indulging in a raging polemic, never sparing the world's governments in the process. The material gives the book a heavy-handed tone, which is echoed by Stephen Hoye's theatrical reading. His delivery is as clipped as the sails of Cousteau's beloved CALYPSO. Hoye doesn't attempt to evoke Cousteau's distinctly French parlance, but where he does match Cousteau is in his sanctimonious quality, which reinforces the text's strident tendencies.

Determined to maintain their Code of Conduct, the POWs developed a powerful underground resistance. To quash it, their captors singled out its eleven leaders, Vietnam's own "dirty dozen," and banished them to an isolated jail that would become known as Alcatraz. None would leave its solitary cells and interrogation rooms unscathed; one would never return.</p><p>As these eleven men suffered in Hanoi, their wives at home launched an extraordinary campaign that would ultimately spark the nationwide POW/MIA movement. The members of these military families banded together and showed the courage not only to endure years of doubt about the fate of their husbands and fathers, but to bravely fight for their safe return. When the survivors of Alcatraz finally came home, one veteran would go on to receive the Medal of Honor, another would become a U.S. Senator, and a third still serves in the U.S. Congress.</p><p>A powerful story of survival and triumph, Alvin Townley's <i>Defiant</i> will inspire anyone wondering how courage, faith, and brotherhood can endure even in the darkest of situations.</p></p><p><p>ALVIN TOWNLEY is the acclaimed author of <i>Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts</i>, <i>Spirit of Adventure: Eagle Scouts and the Making of America's Future</i>, and <i>Fly Navy: Discovering the Extraordinary People and Enduring Spirit of Naval Aviation</i>. He lives in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>BLACK SEA AND AMERICAN FIREPOWER <br>Even at 43,000 tons and nearly three football fields in length, the USS <i>Ticonderoga</i> rolled with the swells of the South China Sea. She had cruised the waters of the Pacific Ocean for more than twenty years now, surviving a 1945 kamikaze attack off Taiwan and steaming victoriously into Tokyo Bay six months later. In the summer of 1964, <i>Ticonderoga</i> had deployed to monitor a new conflict in Asia&#x2014;one between Communist North Vietnam and the American-allied government in the South. Should the growing unrest finally draw America into war, she would respond with her force of more than fifty modern aircraft. <br>The carrier&#x2019;s flight deck resembled the busiest of airports, as if the substantial traffic and activity at O&#x2019;Hare or LaGuardia were compressed onto a 2-acre expanse of concrete surrounded by a 52-foot cliff. Idle planes sat chained mere feet away from the ship&#x2019;s narrow landing strip. In between aircraft recoveries, taxiing jets laden with fuel and bombs jockeyed toward the two forward catapults that sent aircraft screaming off the bow, bathing everything behind them with heat, noise, and thick exhaust. Among the jet blasts and spinning propellers scurried men in grease-smudged pants and shirts of every color. Some lugged heavy chains, others pushed carts of ordnance, all shared a common mission. <br>Commander Jim Stockdale landed amid this chaos on August 4, 1964. He taxied to a stop, shut down the engine of his Vought F-8 Crusader, and climbed out of its single-seat cockpit. He stepped down the ladder to the deck and gazed west into the sunset. Then he watched distant lightning flicker to the north, over the Gulf of Tonkin. Hungry after a long day of patrols, he headed below deck for dinner, away from the noise and commotion. <br>The ship&#x2019;s wardroom was testament to the adage that if a navy man gave his life for his country, he&#x2019;d die clean and well fed. Stewards served dishes of hot food to officers seated at linen-covered tables. A mess officer made sure everyone maintained decorum. If an aviator had already flown his missions for the day, as Jim had, a hot shower might follow the evening meal. Later, each would fall asleep in shared staterooms. Squadron commanders&#x2014;known as skippers&#x2014;like Stockdale often rated a room to themselves. Regardless of their rank or roots, these naval aviators&#x2014;most of whom had yet to see age thirty-five, and many younger than thirty&#x2014;shared a certain confidence. <br>That armor was forged by surviving flight after flight and beating the grim statistics of midcentury military aviation. At the outset of flight training, many instructors warned students that their aircraft would try to kill them. Many planes succeeded. In 1956 alone, naval aviation lost 776 aircraft and 535 lives. One study gave career aviators a 23 percent chance of dying in a crash. Another offered even odds that they&#x2019;d eject before they retired, an unpleasant prospect given the severe injuries pilots often sustained when blasted out of their cockpits and into an unforgiving airstream. Then the pilot could only hope his parachute would open correctly and prevent a tragic freefall. <br>Yet despite these risks, a certain breed of man still volunteered, men who believed they could meet any challenge and hungered for the chance to prove it. Jim Stockdale knew too many who&#x2019;d died amid smashed metal and hot-burning wreckage, but he believed that he would avoid that fate; <i>he</i> would return. Through a combination of heavenly grace, raw talent, and navy training, he controlled his airplane and his destiny. Those that perished had made some mistake, had committed some error, had not lived up to the standard. Stepping into a jet cockpit on the pitching deck of an aircraft carrier required trust in self and machine as well as a belief in the former&#x2019;s dominance over the latter. He, just like everyone else in the wardroom, thought he could control the uncontrollable. <br>After dinner, Jim retired to Fighter Squadron 51&#x2019;s briefing room, where fewer rules of etiquette applied. These rooms were the domain of the ship&#x2019;s aviators and seemed like both an office and a fraternity house. In the room&#x2019;s red lighting, Jim relaxed as pilots often do&#x2014;by talking about flying. Suddenly, he heard propellers turning on the flight deck: A-1 Skyraiders. Just as he began wondering why <i>Ticonderoga</i> had decided to launch aircraft at this late hour, an officer from the ship&#x2019;s Combat Information Center opened the ready room door and asked Jim, &#x201c;Are they ready to go?&#x201d; <br>He explained that two U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin expected an imminent attack from North Vietnamese torpedo boats; the American ships were presenting a show of force as they gathered intelligence. Two days earlier, Jim had defended one of these destroyers, the <i>Maddox,</i> from three such boats, firing the navy&#x2019;s first shots in the escalating conflict with North Vietnam. This evening, <i>Ticonderoga</i> again received orders to scramble her Combat Air Patrol&#x2014;the two Crusaders from Jim&#x2019;s squadron that remained armed, manned, and ready on catapults 1 and 2. Jim knew both CAP pilots were relatively inexperienced, and this mission&#x2019;s sensitive nature called for a veteran. Jim had the cooler head of a senior officer and the fresh experience of his recent attack on the torpedo boats. Besides, he didn&#x2019;t want to miss a fight. So he buckled his survival gear over his flight suit, grabbed his helmet, and climbed the ladder to the flight deck. He opened the metal hatch and stepped out into the din and darkness of nighttime flight operations. Toward the bow, Jim saw swarms of men wearing reflective coats and holding lighted wands to direct the launch of his squadron&#x2019;s two aircraft. He dashed across the darkened flight deck to the closest Crusader, climbed to the cockpit, and relieved its startled pilot. &#x201c;Unstrap and get out,&#x201d; Jim ordered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting in!&#x201d; <br>As deckhands finished harnessing the Crusader to the catapult, Jim looked to his rearview mirror and admired the lean body of his aircraft. Behind the cockpit lay a monstrous turbojet engine that would send him racing through the sky faster than the speed of sound. Missiles hung beneath the plane&#x2019;s swept-back wings. Quite literally, he sat perched on a rocket&#x2019;s nose, about to join the fray. James Bond Stockdale&#x2014;call sign 007&#x2014;had never wanted to be anyplace else. <br>The square-faced forty-one-year-old had wanted this job since his boyhood, when his father, a retired navy chief petty officer, had taken his seven-year-old son east from Abington, Illinois, to Annapolis, Maryland, to witness midshipmen on parade at the U.S. Naval Academy. He heard the drums. He felt the spirit of the storied institution in its eighty-five-year history, its revered graduates, its regimented students, its unmistakable purpose. Four years later, Jim&#x2019;s father took him to see the celebrated polar explorer Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd deliver the 1935 graduation address at Iowa Wesleyan College. Fresh from an Antarctic expedition, Byrd had worn his service dress whites that day. The high-collared uniform, appointed with gold naval aviator&#x2019;s wings and rows of ribbons across the left side of the chest, captivated young Jim. He promised himself that one day he, like this admiral and adventurer, would accomplish something great. <br>Occasionally, a father&#x2019;s dreams for his son coincide with his son&#x2019;s own aspirations; this became the case for Vernon and Jim Stockdale. Father and son hoped that the academy would accept Jim into the brigade after he graduated high school. Jim&#x2019;s father provided the encouragement, Jim did the work, and in June 1943 he joined the Class of 1947. <br>Regular performance reports ushered him quickly up the ranks after graduation. The reports graded him on an extensive list of qualities related to running an organization and carrying out his duties as an officer. The navy had developed Jim into an exceptional aviator, but it had first taught him to lead men. Those lessons in leadership had in no way diminished his love of flight and of the open sky. By the time he had begun his present tour as squadron commander with Fighter Squadron 51&#x2014;the Screaming Eagles&#x2014;he had already excelled as an aviator and officer in the eighteen years since he entered the fleet. He&#x2019;d even served as an instructor at the elite navy test pilot school at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, Maryland. <br>From the dark cockpit, his blue eyes watched for the catapult officer&#x2019;s signals. Jim saw him spin his hand rapidly and pressed the throttle forward, feeling the Crusader&#x2019;s engine strain against the catapult, which would soon accelerate his plane from a standstill to 150 knots. Those jarring three seconds of his flight would be the only ones when he&#x2019;d relinquish control. Jim signaled the officer with his external lights, and moments later catapult and engine launched pilot and jet into the black void at deck&#x2019;s end. Aloft, Jim climbed northwest toward the fight. <br>Shortly after 9:00 P.M., he neared the sector the two destroyers were patrolling and descended through clouds and rain, firing several bursts from his four 20 mm cannons to ensure each barrel worked smoothly. According to reports coming through his radio, the two ships had identified contacts on their radar that the crew suspected were hostile torpedo boats. <br>Once below cloud level, Jim spied two wakes glowing with phosphoresce on the dark sea; he traced them to <i>Maddox</i> and <i>Turner Joy.</i> He dropped lower, to 1,000 feet, darting over the waters around the ships, searching for the reported boats. He canvassed the entire area but saw nothing. Around 9:30 P.M., <i>Maddox</i> fired illuminating star shells to the east, where her radar had detected inbound contacts. <i>Turner Joy</i> began shelling with no results. Then a new cry went up: &#x201c;Torpedo in the water!&#x201d; During the next hour, the <i>Maddox</i> reported twenty-two enemy torpedoes, yet <i>Turner Joy</i> reported none. The ships maneuvered across the sea, zigzagging to avoid the feared torpedoes, firing at suspected targets that seemed to appear and disappear on their radars, and directing the aircraft overhead toward the same. The executive officer aboard <i>Maddox</i> observed Jim&#x2019;s daring maneuvers and thought the aviator either insane or the finest pilot he&#x2019;d ever seen. <br>By the time <i>Turner Joy</i> and <i>Maddox</i> ceased firing, the destroyers had sent more than three hundred rounds into the night. Inside his cockpit, Jim wondered what kind of circus he&#x2019;d joined. While frenzied men aboard the ships had reported wakes, searchlights, muzzle flashes, torpedoes, and enemy boats, Jim had seen absolutely nothing. Perhaps unbeknown to the crew, the peculiar atmospheric conditions over the gulf were capable of causing false radar contacts, and the stormy murkiness of that August night&#x2014;a radarman aboard USS <i>Maddox</i> called the night &#x201c;darker than the hubs of hell&#x201d;&#x2014;had added to the confusion. <br>Exhausted, irritated, and low on fuel, Jim winged home to <i>Ticonderoga.</i> He found the ship&#x2019;s wake on the vast sea and lined up behind its distant runway of lights, which steadily grew larger in his view. He finessed his throttle and controls until he thundered over the carrier&#x2019;s stern. His wheels squeaked onto the deck, and he felt his tailhook snag an arresting cable. When the jet had decelerated and stopped safely, he climbed out of the cockpit, still mulling the night&#x2019;s strange turns. <br>He walked into the ready room, and his squadron mates asked, &#x201c;What the hell has been going on out there?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Damned if I know,&#x201d; Jim said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really a flap. The guy on the <i>Maddox</i> air control radio was giving blow-by-blow accounts&nbsp;&#x2026; turning left, turning right, torpedoes to the right of us, torpedoes to the left of us&#x2014;boom, boom, boom! I got right down there and shot at whatever they were shooting at.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Did you see any boats?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not a one,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;No boats, no boat wakes, no ricochets off boats, no boat gunfire, no torpedo wakes.&#x201d; <br>After he filed his debrief, baffling reports from <i>Maddox</i> and <i>Turner Joy</i> began filtering into the ready room. The destroyer captains first claimed their guns had sunk or damaged several boats. Then they began to question their equipment and their men; they second-guessed the entire incident. No witness aboard either ship had definitively seen anything. Shortly after midnight, the commander of the two destroyers, Captain John Herrick, cabled a telling flash message that advised, &#x201c;Review of action makes many recorded contacts and torpedoes fired appear doubtful. Freak weather effects and overeager sonarmen may have accounted for many reports. No actual visual sightings by <i>Maddox.</i> Suggest complete evaluation before any further actions.&#x201d; When Jim learned of Herrick&#x2019;s last communiqu�, he tossed his helmet at the ceiling and stormed off to bed, annoyed that he&#x2019;d just risked his life for absolutely nothing. <br>Ever since Jim and his wingmen first dueled with and damaged three torpedo boats on August 2, President Lyndon Johnson saw conflict in the Gulf of Tonkin as an excuse to escalate U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Even as uncertain and conflicting accounts of what had transpired two nights later arrived in Washington, President Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara decided to retaliate for what they considered two North Vietnamese provocations: one on August 2 and one on August 4. In their living rooms, thirteen hours after the second incident, Americans watched their president condemn the attacks and announce the nation&#x2019;s response. &#x201c;[America&#x2019;s] reply,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is being given as I speak to you tonight. Air action is now in execution against gunboats and certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam which have been used in these hostile operations.&#x201d; <br>As Johnson spoke, viewers could envision a deluge of bombs avenging the two reported attacks, when in fact the bombs had yet to fall. Jim Stockdale had been rousted out of his bunk only several hours earlier, as August 5 dawned on the waters off Vietnam, to lead the first wave of aircraft off <i>Ticonderoga;</i> the planes had launched less than an hour before Johnson&#x2019;s speech. In a move that foreshadowed the disconnect that would persist between battlefield pilots and Washington strategists throughout the coming war, President Johnson announced the attacks before bombs had been dropped. His words helped alert the North Vietnamese to the American warplanes that were at that moment approaching their coastline, led by the skeptical yet duty-bound aviator who&#x2019;d been involved in both Gulf of Tonkin incidents. <br>In the years following, the government never ascertained exactly what transpired on the Gulf of Tonkin that night of August 4, when the supposed second attack took place. For his part, Jim Stockdale maintained that he&#x2019;d seen nothing but &#x201c;black sea and American firepower.&#x201d; Given the twenty-year collision course charted by Washington and Hanoi, however, if the August incident had not escalated the conflict, another incident almost certainly would have. Regardless, President Johnson used the episode to pass the Joint Resolution on Southeast Asia&#x2014;widely known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution&#x2014;on August 7. The resolution, which passed unanimously in the U.S. House and almost so in the Senate, authorized the president to send combat forces into Vietnam without a declaration of war. <br>The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and the military escalation that followed led the United States into a long war&#x2014;one never officially declared&#x2014;that would drastically affect millions of Vietnamese and American lives. It was a war that would leave Jim Stockdale and hundreds of other U.S. servicemen languishing in North Vietnamese prisons, some without their families&#x2019; knowledg...</p><h2>Esta Noche En El Titanic (Tonight On The Titanic) (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition) (La Casa Del Arbol / Magic Tree House)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Find the beginning, the slight silver key to unlock it, to dig it out. Here then is a maze to begin, be in. (p. 20)<br></i><br>Funny yet horrifying, improvisational yet highly distilled, unflinchingly violent yet tender and elegiac, Michael Ondaatje&#x2019;s ground-breaking book <b>The Collected Works of Billy the Kid</b> is a highly polished and self-aware lens focused on the era of one of the most mythologized anti-heroes of the American West. This revolutionary collage of poetry and prose, layered with photos, illustrations and &#x201c;clippings,&#x201d; astounded Canada and the world when it was first published in 1969. It earned then-little-known Ondaatje his first of several Governor General&#x2019;s Awards and brazenly challenged the world&#x2019;s notions of history and literature. <br><br>Ondaatje&#x2019;s Billy the Kid (aka William H. Bonney / Henry McCarty / Henry Antrim) is not the clich�d dimestore comicbook gunslinger later parodied within the pages of this book. Instead, he is a beautiful and dangerous chimera with a voice: driven and kinetic, he also yearns for blankness and rest. A poet and lover, possessing intelligence and sensory discernment far beyond his life&#x2019;s 21 year allotment, he is also a resolute killer. His friend and nemesis is Sheriff Pat Garrett, who will go on to his own fame (or infamy) for Billy&#x2019;s execution. Himself a web of contradictions, Ondaatje&#x2019;s Garrett is &#x201c;a sane assassin sane assassin sane assassin sane assassin sane assassin sane&#x201d; (p. 29) who has taught himself a language he&#x2019;ll never use and has trained himself to be immune to intoxication. As the hero and anti-hero engage in the counterpoint that will lead to Billy&#x2019;s predetermined death, they are joined by figures both real and imagined, including the homesteaders John and Sallie Chisum, Billy&#x2019;s lover Angela D, and a passel of outlaws and lawmakers. The voices and images meld, joined by Ondaatje&#x2019;s own, in a magnificent polyphonic dream of what it means to feel and think and freely act, knowing this breath is your last and you are about to be trapped by history.<br><br><i>I am here with the range for everything<br>corpuscle muscle hair<br>hands that need the rub of metal<br>those senses that<br>that want to crash things with an axe<br>that listen to deep buried veins in our palms<br>those who move in dreams over your women night<br>near you, every paw, the invisible hooves<br>the mind&#x2019;s invisible blackout the intricate never<br>the body&#x2019;s waiting rut.<br>(p. 72)</i></p><p>Michael Ondaatje is the author of five novels, a memoir, a nonfiction book on film, and ten other books of poetry. <b>The English Patient</b> won, amongst other awards, the Booker Prize; <b>Anil&#x2019;s Ghost</b> won the Irish Times International Fiction Prize, the Giller Prize, and the Prix Medicis.

There were five of us together then. Wilson, Dave Rudabaugh, Charlie Bowdre, Tom O&#x2019;Folliard, and me. In November we celebrated my 21st birthday, mixing red dirt and alcohol&#x2013;a public breathing throughout the night. The next day we were told that Pat Garrett had been made sheriff and had accepted it. We were bad for progress in New Mexico and cattle politicians like Chisum wanted the bad name out. They made Garrett sheriff and he sent me a letter saying move out or I will get you Billy. The government sent a Mr. Azariah F. Wild to help him out. Between November and December I killed Jim Carlyle over some mixup, he being <br>a friend.<br><br>Tom O&#x2019;Folliard decided to go east then, said he would meet up with us in Sumner for Christmas. Goodbye goodbye. A few days before Christmas we were told that Garrett was in Sumner waiting for us all. Christmas night. Garrett, Mason, Wild, with four or five others. Tom O&#x2019;Folliard rides into town, leaning his rifle between the horse&#x2019;s ears. He would shoot from the waist now which, with a rifle, was pretty good, and he was always accurate.<br><br>Garrett had been waiting for us, playing poker with the others, guns on the floor beside them. Told that Tom was riding in alone, he went straight to the window and shot O&#x2019;Folliard&#x2019;s horse dead. Tom collapsed with the horse still holding the gun and blew out Garrett&#x2019;s window. Garrett already halfway downstairs. Mr. Wild shot at Tom from the other side of the street, rather unnecessarily shooting the horse again. If Tom had used stirrups and didnt swing his legs so much he would probably have been locked under the animal. O&#x2019;Folliard moved soon. When Garrett had got to ground level, only the horse was there in the open street, good and dead. He couldnt shout to ask Wild where O&#x2019;Folliard was or he would&#x2019;ve got busted. Wild started <br>to yell to tell Garrett though and Tom killed him at once. Garrett fired at O&#x2019;Folliard&#x2019;s flash and took his shoulder off. Tom O&#x2019;Folliard screaming out onto the quiet Fort Sumner street, Christmas night, walking over to Garrett, no shoulder left, his jaws tilting up and down like mad bladders going. Too mad to even aim at Garrett. Son of a bitch son of a bitch, as Garrett took clear aim and blew him out.<br><br>Garrett picked him up, the head broken in two, took him back upstairs into the hotel room. Mason stretched out a blanket neat in the corner. Garrett placed Tom O&#x2019;Folliard down, broke open Tom&#x2019;s rifle, took the remaining shells and placed them by him. They had to wait till morning now. They continued their poker game till six a.m. Then remembered they hadnt done anything about Wild. So the four of them went out, brought Wild into the room. At eight in the morning Garrett buried Tom O&#x2019;Folliard. He had known him quite well. Then he went to the train station, put Azariah F. Wild on ice and sent him back to Washington.<br><br>*<br><br>In Boot Hill there are over 400 graves. It takes <br>the space of 7 acres.

But in the water supply of Rome, horroras Marcus Didius Falco is about to find out. Sharing an ewer of Spanish red with his old friend and new partner Petronius Longus, Falco is on the spot when a man cleaning the local fountain makes a gruesome discovery: a human hand. Small and evidently female, the hand suggests its owner met a terrifying fate. Naturally, Falco and Petro, formerly of the Vigiles, want to seize on it as their first big case. The officials of Rome, however, prefer to hush up the incident, since a population that riots at the drop of a toga might run wild if body parts are polluting their drinking water. Soon other delicate, dismembered hands are being found in Rome's two hundred miles of aqueduct. Now aided, inspired, and given critical clues by his wife, Helena, Falco &amp; Partner are ready to buck the status quo and even butt heads with Falco's old boss, Chief Spy Anacrites, to crack the case. But O, Hades! The duo suspects a serial killer is at large, linked topublic festivals, and likely to strike again at the upcoming Roman Games.

Cox shows how we can extrapolate from Jesus' parables and bridge the gap between the ancient and modern worlds.<br>When Jesus Came to Harvard is not another look at the "historical Jesus," but it considers Jesus' contemporary significance by concentrating on the stories he told and those told about him. For youth and adults, Christian and non-Christian, When Jesus Came to Harvard is urgently relevant.</p><p>HARVEY COX is the author of the groundbreaking The Secular City and many other books, including The Seduction of the Spirit, which was nominated for the National Book Award. A professor of theology at Harvard Divinity School, he lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Chapter 1<br><br>He Was Then, We Are Now<br><br>Twenty centuries sixty generations have passed since Jesus of Nazareth lived. The people who met or heard him then numbered only in the hundreds, or a few thousand at most. The Romans did not consider him significant enough to record his execution in their annals. He wrote no books. No monuments were erected in his memory. Yet today countless people believe that he has an important moral significance, not just for his time, but for ours as well. Still, they are often perplexed and frustrated about just what that significance is.<br>Many experts, from TV evangelists to university researchers, claim in self-assured tones to speak authoritatively about Jesus. But they have so many different and conflicting interpretations of him, they cannot all be right.<br><br>One way I tried to close the then/now gap was to introduce the students to a number of recent figures for whom Jesus was the principal inspiration. We studied Gandhi, who never became a Christian but tried to base his life on the Sermon on the Mount. We read about Martin Luther King, who found in Jesus the model for his own nonviolence and a racially inclusive community. We talked about Dorothy Day, the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement, who tried her best to follow Jesus&#x2019; pattern of poverty and simplicity.<br>I told the class about Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German pastor whose determination to follow Jesus in Nazi Germany led him to join the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and who was hanged by the Gestapo just hours before the Americans arrived at his concentration camp in Flossenburg. Many students chose to write their term papers on one of these twentieth-century disciples of Jesus. In a world full of celebrity idols with oversize clay feet, they seemed to be looking for credible moral heroes.<br>Jesus obviously provided a powerful example of someone who took the side of the dispossessed, spoke truth to power, and was willing to pay the price of his convictions.<br><br>But there was still something missing.<br>Even the most thoughtful students had a hard time finding in Jesus&#x2019; life and teaching much concrete guidance in making the day-to-day decisions they faced.<br>One day a candid junior who was active in the local Lutheran church asked me a simple question: Why does nearly everyone we study in this course end up getting crucified, shot, or hanged?&#x201d; He was referring to Jesus, Gandhi, King, and Bonhoeffer. But he was not being flip. He told me he had no ambition to get rich or famous, and that he was genuinely inspired by Jesus&#x2019; concern for the outcast people of his day. But, he said, he did want to find a satisfying job someday, get married, raise a family, and be a good citizen of his community and of the world. Naturally, he wanted to do the right thing. But he did not feel up to confronting the Roman legions.<br><br>Sometimes the most devout students told me they prayed to Jesus for guidance about their choices, and I believe they did. But when they looked to him as a living example of how to make moral decisions, they were often puzzled. The Sermon on the Mount seemed compelling to them, and I am sure many would have at least tried to turn the other cheek,&#x201d; and even to love their enemies. But were they really supposed to take Jesus&#x2019; admonition literally, sell everything they had, and give it to the homeless people in Harvard Square? Did I seriously expect them to take no thought for the morrow,&#x201d; as Jesus taught, when I had assigned term papers and scheduled a final exam? In short, they found Jesus powerfully attractive, but it was hard to make a moral connection with him.<br><br>It was not just the Christians who found Jesus both appealing and puzzling. The Jewish students who knew their own religion recognized him as a fellow Jew in the tradition of the prophets, like Isaiah and Jeremiah. Buddhists immediately saw him as a bodhisattva, one who chooses to forgo entering nirvana so he can help all sentient creatures to do so as well. Muslims also considered him one of the prophets and frequently reminded me that he receives a prominent role in the Qur&#x2019;an. They all considered him a virtually incomparable model of courage and self-sacrifice. But as a guide to thinking through today&#x2019;s issues, he seemed somehow unavailable. A middleaged visiting scholar from India, a Hindu economist who audited the course, once told me he found Jesus extraordinarily admirable and could well understand why Gandhi had followed his example.<br>Like the mahatma, he said, he also had a picture of Jesus on the wall of his room. Buut, he added, the life of Jesus had ended at the age of thirty-three. He had never entered what the Hindus call the householder&#x201d; stage of life, nor the ascetic or sunyasi&#x201d; phase, which comes with advanced years. How could one follow him into one&#x2019;s fifties and sixties and beyond? Sinceeeee I myself was entering that last phase I knew immediately what he was saying.<br>Still, I saw little point in telling him that the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche had once speculated about the same question and had suggested that if Jesus had not died so young, he might eventually have outgrown his youthful exuberance, calmed down, and become a different kind of person. Who knows? Still, it is hard to imagine Jesus collecting Social Security or playing shuffleboard in Fort Lauderdale.<br><br>During the years I was teaching the course many people hoped that the widely heralded Jesus seminar&#x201d; and the search for the historical Jesus&#x201d; might produce an answer to the mystery of who he really was. Now, they thought, at last they could know the true Jesus, shorn of all those confusing myths and legends. But they were quickly disappointed, the more so since the project appeared at first to be such a promising one. There are, however, understandable reasons for both its waxing and its waning. The Jesus seminar&#x201d; began with an intriguing question: What can we say about Jesus if we restrict ourselves solely to currently accepted methods of historical research? What profile of him emerges if we scrape away the many layers of myth that have encrusted his figure over the centuries?<br>What happens if we treat the New Testament Gospels no dif- ferently from other contemporary ancient sources, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas? What is added when we turn to the archaeology of ancient Palestine; what can anthropology teach us about the structure of colonized peasant societies like the one Jesus lived in? It sounded like an exciting enterprise that might yield a morally relevant Jesus, at least for those who wanted to emulate him. For a few years this quest for the historical Jesus captured much of the class&#x2019;s, and the public&#x2019;s, attention.<br><br>There is little doubt that the notoriety many weekly newsmagazines and TV shows lavished on the project helped make it more widely known. The media had previously suspected that featuring stories about Jesus was a guaranteed way to win readers and viewers, and they were right. Even after two thousand years, Jesus of Nazareth remains an enormously fascinating figure and continues to be an integral part of the collective human psyche in large parts of the world. This is true whether or not one is a Christian or even conventionally religious. Atheists and agnostics have written appreciative books on Jesus. Nearly everyone believes he ought to have some moral significance, but much confusion and conflict remains about just what it should be, and about what following Jesus&#x201d; in this or that situation would actually mean.<br>Much of this disagreement has arisen from the radically different portraits of him that interpreters have made over the years: the gentle carpenter, the fiery prophet, the divine lover, the miraculous healer, and the pale mystic.<br>In recent years Jesus has even appeared as a rock singer in Jesus Christ Superstar, a circus clown in Godspell, the husband of Mary Magdalene in The Da Vinci Code, and a helpless victim beaten to a bloody pulp in The Passion of the Christ. But many people wondered still, who was he really? Now, with the scientific historians of the Jesus seminar eagerly at work, perhaps this question would at last be answered. No wonder the public was fascinated.<br><br>In addition, we live in an era of spins and cover stories, of doctored accounts and now it can be told&#x201d; journalism. People often discount official versions of anything and suspect they are being deceived or duped. Consequently, when ordinary people learned, not from the pulpit but from the local kiosk, that the biblical Gospels were written many years after the events they describe, that they were pieced together from earlier sources, and that they were edited for particular audiences, they wanted to find out the inside story.&#x201d; Now the Jesus seminar&#x2019;s quest for the historical Jesus, which hit its stride during the early 1990s, was there with the answers. It assured the public that thanks to carbon dating, computer databases, and a strictly scientific approach to the question, at last we could know who the real Jesus&#x201d; was. Naturally the public curiosity was kindled.<br>At a time when historical revisionists were overturning previously sacred versions of everything from the legends of Jesse James to the Vietnam War, the public&#x2019;s fascination with the search for the Jesus of history&#x201d; was understandable. Besides, it sold lots of magazines.<br>So why did the disappointment set in so quickly?<br><br>It soon became obvious that the historians carrying on the quest were coming to a bewildering set of contradictory conclusions about who Jesus really was. Some depicted him as a wandering sage, others as a charismatic preacher, and still others as a religiously inspired social revolutionary. Their disagreement baffled and annoyed those who believed the search was a genuinely scientific undertaking, the religious equivalent of the genome project, and that it would produce a clear and final answer. But it turned out that the answer to the question, Who was this Jesus, really?&#x201d; was as hard to answer as it had ever been. Why had such a mountainous scholarly effort produced such a molehill of results?<br><br>This impatient dismissal of the historical Jesus project was not entirely fair. Despite widespread discrepancies among the researchers, some things were not contested. All agreed that Jesus really had existed, and that he was a first-century Palestinian Jew living under the heel of a Roman occupation that like many such occupations before and since had split its captive people into feuding sects and warring factions. They also agreed that he was a rabbi who taught the imminent coming of the kingdom of God, and gained a following as a teacher and a healer in Galilee, especially among the landless and destitute, but that he aroused the ire of the nervous ruling religious circles and the tense Roman authorities. When he and some of his followers arrived in Jerusalem for the Passover holidays he caused a stir in the Temple, was arrested, interrogated, and executed by crucifixion, a form of death by torture reserved by the Romans for those suspected of subverting their imperial rule. But after his death, his followers insisted that he had appeared to them alive, and they continued to spread his message even in the face of harsh persecution.<br><br>Beyond this tiny historical capsule of raw data there is an ocean of additional material about Jesus that does not pass muster with scientific historians. Much of it is in the Bible itself. But there are also teachings and sayings attributed to Jesus and stories about him in the sources called the apocryphal Gospels that the early Christians chose not to include in the New Testament. There are also numerous legends about Jesus for example, that he journeyed to India or Tibet or Japan during the silent years&#x201d; between his twelfth birthday and the three years preceding his early death, a period the Gospels simply skip over. But there is no historical evidence whatever for any of these intriguing travelogues.<br>The sum of the matter is that although we do know something about the historical Jesus,&#x201d; meaning the bare facts that can be uncovered by contemporary historical research, this method does not yield very much, and probably never will. Even carbon dating and archaeology have their limits.<br>Still, the search for the historical Jesus had not really failed. It had done much of what it set out to do.<br>It had simply not lived up to its inflated advance billings or the exaggerated expectations of its audience.<br><br>This is not, however, the main reason why the celebrated quest for the historical Jesus frustrated so many people. It was disappointing not because it produced so little, but because what little it produced seemed so irrelevant. It not only uncovered Jesus as a historical figure, it also left him as one.<br>Paradoxically, this subverts what the same scholars believe was the central message of the historical Jesus. They all agree that Jesus insisted his hearers respond to the presence of God in the here and now.&#x201d; The best that historical reconstruction can do, however, is to leave Jesus in the there and then.&#x201d; He is still the robed, bearded figure of the Sunday school books and the Jesus movies romantic, tragic, heroic but no closer to us than Socrates or Julius Caesar. He is fascinating but inaccessible, living in a strange world very different from ours, grappling with issues unlike those we confront.<br><br>Despite the failure of the quest for the historical Jesus to satisfy the unrealistic expectations it engendered, some people continue to hope that eventually historical research one more frayed old scroll dug out of one more cave will clarify who Jesus really was.<br>Others still think that asking, What would Jesus do in this situation?&#x201d; will resolve any dilemma. The problem with the first hope is that, except for the barest essentials, historians will always disagree about Jesus, and a whole cave full of scrolls will not tell us for sure who he really was.&#x201d; Consequently, when we read their differing accounts of his life or see a film or TV show about him, we often feel we are catching a fleeting glimpse of an elusive, distant figure on the other side of a wide abyss. The problem with simply asking what Jesus would do is that we grapple with many choices today that Jesus never had to face, so trying to speculate on what he would do when faced with a controversial modern dilemma is anyone&#x2019;s guess.<br>The students in the course knew this all too well. They recognized that Jesus never had to endure a series of exhausting job interviews, cope with an unintended pregnancy, or (as far as we know) weigh the consequences of breaking up with a girlfriend. Looking ahead in their own lives, they knew Jesus never had to worry about a fifteen-year-old son he suspected might be taking drugs, or decide how to tell his parents about a sweetheart they would surely not approve of, or agonize over whether to place his failing mother Mary in a retirement community, or consent to disconnecting his father Joseph&#x2019;s life-support system if the cancer had spread to all his organs.<br>On issues like humanitarian military intervention, reproductive cloning, or doctor-assisted suicide, students could find no clear answers in his life and teaching or else they found a range of con- flicting ones. Try as they would, they continued to see Jesus on the other side of a wide chasm. He was still then, and they were clearly now.<br><br>These students were not alone. Similar questions stalk anyone who lives in a society without a widely accepted moral frame of reference.<br>Many thoughtful people now insist that we should put values back into education.&#x201d; They may be right. But if we do, whose values shall we teach?

Sabrina Matthews, a young prostitute in the rough frontier city of Denver, is befriended by a police officer and his wife. Because of their kindness, she listens to what they have to say about Jesus and believes in Him.</p> <p>Sabrina stays with Danny and Callie until she&#x2019;s ready to make a fresh start in a new town. She boards the train for the long trip to Token Creek in Montana Territory, where she meets Jeanette Fulbright and is befriended by the church family and many of the townsfolk there.</p> <p>All is well until she finds herself falling for Pastor Rylan Jarvik, who has begun to care for her as well. Will she be able to tell him about her past? How will Rylan respond? <i>A moving novel about past mistakes and forgiveness&#x2014;both from God and people.</i></p></p><p>Lori Wick is the bestselling author of more than 30 books (nearly 5 million copies sold), including the popular Rocky Mountain Memories Series, the Yellow Rose Trilogy, and stand-alone novels such as Pretense, The Princess, and Bamboo and Lace. Lori lives in Wisconsin with her husband, Bob, and their three children.In the 1880s frontier town of Denver, Colorado, Danny, a kind policeman, and his wife, Callie, offer help to the beautiful prostitute Sabrina. With warmth and empathy, Jill Shellabarger depicts Sabrina&#39;s acceptance, which gives her hope and a new life in Christ. Shellabarger&#39;s optimistic characterization of Sabrina as she begins a new life contrasts sharply with her later fear of exposure when she travels to the Montana Territories. Shellabarger powerfully portrays Sabrina&#39;s compulsion to turn around the lives of the young women who are practicing prostitution there. With careful pacing Shellabarger also portrays Sabrina&#39;s growing interest in the town&#39;s pastor. Shellabarger gives a polished performance as the author explores themes of forgiveness and new beginnings.

In "The Lottery," Jackson's most famous work and one of the greatest--and scariest--stories of the twentieth century, a small town gathers for an annual ritual that culminates in a terrible event. In "The Daemon Lover," a woman waits, then searches, for the man she is to marry that day, only to find that he has disappeared as completely as if he had never existed. In "Trial by Combat," a shy woman confronts her kleptomaniac neighbor, and in "Pillar of Salt," a tourist in New York is gradually paralyzed by a city grown nightmarish. Throughout these twenty-five tales<br>"Jackson's great gift is not to create a world of fantasy and terror, but rather to discover the existence of the grotesque in the ordinary world. The grotesque is so powerful here just because it takes off from everyday life and constantly returns there until we do not know ourselves quite where we are."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Elizabeth Janeway<br><br></p><h2>The Letter of James (Pillar New Testament Commentary)</h2><p>Few New Testament books have been as controversial and misunderstood as The Letter of James. Its place in the canon was contested by some early Christians, and the reformer Martin Luther called it an &#34;epistle of straw&#34;. The sometimes negative view of the letter among modern theologians, however, is not shared by ordinary believers. Few books in the New Testament are better known or more often quoted, and because James is so concise, so intensely practical, and so filled with memorable metaphors and illustrations, it has become one of the two or three most popular New Testament books in the church.The highly original commentary on James by respected New Testament scholar Douglas Moo combines penetrating scholarship with the simplicity of style and pastoral tone characteristic of James itself. After discussing such background issues as authorship, genre, purpose, structure, and theology, Moo provides a verse-by-verse exposition of the text that leads readers to the heart of James&#39;s message - wholehearted commitment to Christ. In addition to expounding the meaning of James, Moo also takes care to provide practical insights for applying the meaning in the church today. A number of years in the making, interacting with the best and most recent works on James, and written for readers at all levels, this volume will quickly become a standard commentary on James.</p><p>Douglas J. Moo is the Blanchard Professor of New Testament at Wheaton Graduate School, Wheaton, Illinois. He is the author of the Romans volume in The New International Commentary on the New Testament, the volume on James in The Pillar New Testament Commentary, and the volume on James in The Tyndale New Testament Commentary series."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A.

One day on a walk through Paris (a "twelve little girls in two straight lines" kind of walk), Madeline slips and falls off a bridge right into the Seine. Everyone feared she would be dead, "But for a dog / That kept its head," saving her from a "watery grave." What choice do Madeline and the girls have but to take the heroic pooch home, feed her biscuits, milk, and beef, and name her Genevieve? Sadly, when Lord Cucuface gets wind of the new dog, he decrees that no dogs will be allowed in the "old house in Paris that was covered with vines," and kicks Genevieve out on the street. Madeline vows vengeance, and the girls scour Paris looking for the pup: "They went looking high / and low / And every place a dog might go. / In every place they called her name / But no one answered to the same." As we've come to expect from Bemelmans, all's well that ends well chez Clavel, and young readers will be tickled by this heartwarming, quirky dog story with a surprise finale.

A first novel. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Linda Fairstein has run the Sex Crimes Unit of the District Attorney&#39;s office in Manhattan for more than two decades.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> I sat on my living room sofa at five o'clock in the morning with a copy of the mock-up of the front page of the day's <i>New York Post</i> in my hand, looking at my own obituary. The headline I was reading had been prepared hours earlier, when the cops thought that it was my head that had been blown apart by a rifle blast on a quiet country road in a little Massachusetts town called Chilmark. </p><p> <br> SEX PROSECUTOR SLAIN -- FBI, STATE TROOPERS JOIN SEARCH FOR KILLER </p><p> Mike Chapman sat opposite me as he worked on his second egg sandwich and lukewarm cup of coffee. He had brought them along with the news story, and in the fashion of an experienced Homicide detective he continued chewing even as he described to me the details of the murder scene -- bullet holes, blood spatter, and body bag. </p><p> "Good thing you've been a source for so many stories at the <i>Post</i> all these years. It's a very complimentary obit..." He stopped eating long enough for that familiar grin to emerge, then added, "And a great picture of you -- looks like they airbrushed most of your wrinkles out. Your phone'll be ringing off the hook once all those lonely guys in the city realize you're still alive -- maybe you'll get lucky." </p><p> Most of the time Mike could defuse every situation and get me to laugh, but I had been crying for so many hours that it was impossible to respond to his lousy cracks or to focus on anything else but the dreadful day that lay ahead. A woman had been killed on the path leading to my country house, driving a car that had been rented in my name. The body of the tall, slender, thirtyish victim was missing her face, so most of the local cops who arrived on the scene assumed that I had been the target. </p><p> <br> We were more than two hundred miles away from the crime scene, twenty stories above the noise of the garbage trucks that rolled through Manhattan streets every morning before dawn, in the safe confines of my high-rise apartment on the Upper East Side. Too many years of investigating break-ins of brownstones and townhouses, with rapists climbing in from fire escapes or pushing in vestibule doors behind unsuspecting tenants, had driven me to a luxury building -- low on quaintness and charm but high on doormen and rent. My mother had come into town for two weeks to decorate for me when I moved a few years earlier, but the French provincial antiques and lavish Brunschwig fabrics were an incongruous backdrop for this deadly conversation. </p><p> <br> "How'd you get the call?" Mike asked, brushing the crumbs off his slacks and onto the carpet, ready to give me his undivided attention. </p><p> "One of the guys in the unit is about to start a trial in front of Torres and grabbed me just as I was going to leave the office for the night. His victim is a junkie -- she came in to be prepped for court and was so high she couldn't hold her head up. God knows if she remembers anything about the rape. I had to make the arrangements to get a hotel room for her overnight so we could try to dry her out before she gets on the witness stand. By the time we finished it was nine-thirty, and I just called my friend Joan Stafford to meet for a late supper." </p><p> "I didn't ask you for your alibi, for Chrissakes. How'd you hear about this?" </p><p> "I can't even focus straight, Mike. You've got to take me down to my office so I can be there before everyone starts to arrive -- I'll never make it through all the questions." </p><p> "Just talk to me, Alex." </p><p> Reliving the events of the past few hours as a witness and not a prosecutor was an unsettling role for me. I tried to reconstruct what had happened after I walked into my apartment shortly before midnight and headed to the answering machine to play back the messages as I started to undress. </p><p> Beep one: "Hi, Alex. I'm on the Ventura Freeway, taking the baby to his play group. Tell me more about the case with the therapist who seduced his patient. It sounds fascinating. How many people do you think <i>he's</i> fucked up? Speak with you later." Nina Baum, my college roommate, still my best friend, making her regular phone car call from one of the endless L.A. roadways on which she seemed to spend her life </p><p> Beep two: Just the deliberate click of a hang-up call. </p><p> Beep three: "Yo, Coop. Wallace here. The lieutenant asked me to give you a heads up. The Con Ed rapist hit again today. Nothing for you to do now. Lady's been to the hospital and released, so we put her to bed for the night. You do the same, and we'll be down at your office tomorrow. Behave. G'night." The deep, familiar voice of Mercer Wallace, formerly of Homicide, who was now my lead detective in the Special Victims Squad, the unit which investigated all of the sexual assault and child abuse cases that occurred in Manhattan. </p><p> Beep four: "I'm trying to reach a friend or next-of-kin to Alexandra Cooper. This is an emergency. Please call me, Chief Wally Flanders, Chilmark Police -- Martha's Vineyard. It's urgent -- give a call as soon as you get this message. Area code 508-555-3044. Thanks." </p><p> Of course I had known Wally for more than a decade -- I had been going to the Vineyard since I had been in law school, and Wally was as much a local fixture as the fishing boats and the general store. </p><p> I picked up the phone to dial, wondering why he was looking for a friend or relative at my apartment instead of asking for me. When he got on the line, he expressed how surprised he was to hear my voice. "Where are you?" he asked. </p><p> "In Manhattan, in my apartment, Chief." </p><p> "Well, Alex, there's been a terrible tragedy here. Terrible. Was there somebody stayin' at your house, somebody you let use it?" </p><p> "Yes, Wally, a friend of mine is there. It's okay, she'll be staying there for a week or two. It's no problem, I've arranged everything." </p><p> My mind was racing but I had never connected the Vineyard with any kind of crime problem except the occasional house burglary. That's why it has always been such a refuge for me, a world away from the grim business of investigating and prosecuting rape cases. Someone must have noticed an unfamiliar person coming or going into Daggett's Pond Way and suspected a burglary. </p><p> "Not so easy, Alex. Your friend isn't staying for as long as you thought. She was shot sometime tonight, see, and my guys found the body a few hours ago. She's dead, Alex, real dead." </p><p> "Oh my God!" I repeated quietly several times into the telephone mouthpiece. I was incredulous, as people always are when they get this kind of news. And as intimately as I have worked with violence and murder for more than ten years, it had never ruptured the fragile line that separated my personal from my professional life. </p><p> "Alex? Alex? Are you alone there?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Can you get someone over to give you a hand with this?" </p><p> With what? I thought. What else could anyone do except stare at me while I spun out of control? </p><p> Wally continued, "See, the big problem is that we thought it was you who got killed. That's why we were tryin' to find your family, for notification. The press already thinks you're the dead woman." </p><p> "How did <i>that</i> happen?" I shrieked at him. </p><p> "Well, it's really ugly. We figure that you -- I mean she was riding in a convertible, top down -- and she had turned off the state road onto that wooded path that leads in to your house. Someone must have been waiting in there for you, and -- excuse me -- just let out a blast which hit her square in the side of her head." </p><p> I don't suppose Wally could hear me but I was sitting on my bedroom floor, crying as he finished his story. </p><p> "We had a call during the evening to go up to the Patterson house, out your way. My boys found the body -- couldn't tell much about anything from looking at her and she didn't have no ID. They called in the license plate and found that the Mustang had been rented in your name. Hell it was your driveway, a rented car, and a girl with a similar build and size -- it made sense that it was you." </p><p> "I guess so," I whimpered back to him. </p><p> "Well I'm glad it's not you, Alex. Everyone will be glad to know it's not you. I figured the investigation would be a monster, tryin' to track down every pervert and madman you've sent to jail. That's why I called in the FBI -- I figured we'd be huntin' all over the place." </p><p> Wally actually laughed a few times at that point. "It's a relief, really, I guess the off-island papers won't even bother with us now." </p><p> The chief had no idea how wrong he was and how bad this was going to be for that tranquil little island. </p><p> "Can you help us, Alex? Can you give us her name and who to notify?" </p><p> I mumbled the name into the phone, but Wally heard it loud and clear. "Isabella Lascar." </p><p> The news wires were about to explode with the information that the face of the dazzlingly beautiful actress and film star, Isabella Lascar, had been obliterated, and that what was left of her body lay in the tiny Vineyard morgue, with a toe tag mislabeled in the name of Alexandra Cooper. </p><p> Copyright � 1996 by Linda Fairstein</p></p><h2>Making Ceramic Sculpture: Techniques * Projects * Inspirations ( A Lark Ceramics Book)</h2><p>The introduction to a popular and under-published aspect of ceramics.

Good toes, naughty toes . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> I watch my feet as they extend into a perfect point, then flex them, feeling the pull of my calf muscles and enjoying the breeze on my skin as I sit with my legs dangling over the Drop.<br> &nbsp;<br> I love it here. Outside. Basking in the warmth of the sun. Heights don&#x2019;t bother me, which is a good thing: I can&#x2019;t remember a time when I didn&#x2019;t live above the clouds in the sanctuary they built for me in which I sleep, eat, learn, and grow. Everything I could ever need is here, within the vast half-bubble of the Dome, where the glass lets the beauty of outside in. Sunbeams bounce off every surface.<br> &nbsp;<br> Up here in my home above the clouds, I can&#x2019;t be seen, or see, thanks to the white cloud lying between us. A constant veil hides the world and me from each other. Occasionally I&#x2019;m sure I can see shapes from the city below, but that might be my imagination.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, I need to be closer to it. I need to experience it. That&#x2019;s why I love sitting on the Drop. This is my spot, my place to escape to at the end of a walkway to nowhere. It is the perfect quiet space in which to mull over the day and my future.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our future.<br> &nbsp;<br> The future.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There you are,&#x201d; Holly says, walking through the glass doors several meters behind me, as though there&#x2019;s anywhere else I&#x2019;d be.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m rarely completely alone out here. Or, rather, I&#x2019;m never out here for long before she shows up. Without tearing my eyes from the beautiful view, I raise a welcoming hand. It&#x2019;s not her fault she interrupts my quiet time. She&#x2019;s only doing as she&#x2019;s told. They want to hear my thoughts--especially now, ahead of tomorrow. So they send her to find me. Holly. My best friend. My constant companion. My anchor. I was in class with her a few minutes ago discussing William Shakespeare&#x2019;s ability to turn tragedy into near comedy. She had some interesting thoughts, which I found intriguing and insightful--sometimes I learn as much from her as I do from whoever is teaching.<br> &nbsp;<br> Holly is different now, though. She&#x2019;s less studious and more . . . accessible.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nice shoes,&#x201d; I say, spotting the orange slip-ons as she sits beside me. Her honey-blond hair is unmoving in the wind, yet she pulls her denim jacket a little tighter, as though she feels a chill.<br> &nbsp;<br> It amuses me that they don&#x2019;t keep her in the same outfit all the time. They select what she wears each day or at each session. Why bother? Perhaps it&#x2019;s to show what&#x2019;s expected of me, or to inspire my own fashion sense, because it&#x2019;s not as though I can learn from others like me. I am the only girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m never directly told what to wear. I can choose from any of the items they&#x2019;ve placed in my wardrobe: mostly vintage garments collected from decades past--geometric prints, bell-bottom pants, shoulder-padded jackets, or pretty shirtdresses.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, I still have the freedom of choice. Take today. This morning I opted for a floaty turquoise summer dress with a dainty white floral pattern. It falls below my knees, exposing an inch or two of naked flesh above the lace-up brown boots I&#x2019;ve teamed it with. I&#x2019;ve seen photos of similar dresses worn with a wedged heel, sandals, or espadrilles, but my footwear must always be laced and tied when I&#x2019;m out on the Drop. No slip-ons for me. Not here.<br> &nbsp;<br> It isn&#x2019;t the same for Holly, which irritates me, although only in the sense that it&#x2019;s a sloppy move on their part. Why implement a regulation, give her to me, then leave a murky area where we aren&#x2019;t tied to the same rules? It makes a mockery of her, and I don&#x2019;t like that.<br> &nbsp;<br> I try not to sigh too heavily, and avert my eyes. I weave my fingers through the ends of my long brown hair, which has become tangled in the breeze.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Mothers used to style it for me when I was younger. Their designs were too intricate for me to grasp back then, but now I have hours to play with my hair and I&#x2019;ve become quite the expert. I can twist, knot, braid, pin . . . The possibilities are endless. For which I&#x2019;m thankful. It gives me something to do. I used to be allowed to experiment with makeup, but now I wear it on special occasions to ensure it&#x2019;s not wasted. As the demand for these products isn&#x2019;t what it once was, there are no new supplies. What I have has to last me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So, tomorrow,&#x201d; Holly starts, breaking the silence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wow, straight in there.&#x201d; I half laugh, turning to see her pale green eyes twinkling as she stares straight ahead. Sometimes she tiptoes around these subjects, leaving me on edge and defensive, as I&#x2019;m unsure where she&#x2019;s leading the conversation. Other times, like in class, all focus is on the work. I prefer it when it&#x2019;s like this. I like her more. It feels more genuine. Almost real.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big day,&#x201d; she states, shrugging her slender shoulders.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Biggest of my life.&#x201d; I nod in agreement, my expression serious now. I want her to think she&#x2019;s pulled me in and that I&#x2019;m ready for a deep and meaningful chat. &#x201c;Well, apart from my birth--that was monumental.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Ancient Art of Color Therapy</h2><p>The Ancient Art of Color Therapy by Linda Clark Softcover book published by Pocket Books, copyright 1975.

The mill has not been operational for more than fifty years, but now the land has been sold to a supermarket chain, and the old building is to be razed to make way for a customer parking lot.&nbsp; The news has prompted vigorous local debate.&nbsp; Some are angry that the city council has allowed part of our municipal heritage to be sold off.&nbsp; Others are excited at the prospect of fresh bagels.&nbsp; Such is progress.&nbsp;</p><p>For myself, I&#x2019;m sorry to see the old place go.&nbsp; I want to pay my last respects, watch the thing go down.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lower end of Bridge Street is lined with mud-encrusted pick-ups and vans.&nbsp; I have to double back and park on the other side of the river.&nbsp; It is a beautiful, fresh spring morning.&nbsp; The faintest of breezes is coming in off the ocean.&nbsp; As I walk across the bridge I can hear someone shouting instructions through a bullhorn.</p><p>Warning signs have been posted along the road, keeping the curious at bay.&nbsp; <i>Authorized Personnel Only</i>.&nbsp; <i>Hard Hat Required</i>.&nbsp; I keep my distance.&nbsp; A huge crane is parked in front of the old building, its arm stretched high into the sky.&nbsp; A wrecking ball hangs at the end of the crane&#x2019;s thick steel rope, fat and heavy with the threat of violence.&nbsp; The mill&#x2019;s giant wooden doors have been padlocked shut my entire life, but now they are opened wide, and early morning sunlight falls into the cathedral-like space where vast pulping machines once rumbled from dawn to dusk, the town&#x2019;s beating heart.&nbsp; Workmen in reflector vests walk in and out, murmuring into walkie-talkies. &nbsp;I guess they are checking all three floors for uninvited visitors before the walls start crashing down.</p><p>The mill&#x2019;s red brick chimney rises tall and straight into the sky. &nbsp;By lunchtime it will be gone.</p><p>At precisely nine o&#x2019;clock there is a long, shrill blast from a whistle.&nbsp; A man climbs into the cabin of the crane and turns on the ignition.&nbsp; As the engine rumbles to life, the arm of the crane begins to move from side to side, and the wrecking ball starts to swing.&nbsp;</p><p>The old mill has been on the brink of demolition for years. &nbsp;Up and down this part of the southern Maine coast, from Biddeford to Brunswick, abandoned industrial buildings have been rescued and revivified, artfully repurposed for twenty-first century living.&nbsp; Those ancient spaces have been reborn as art galleries, office suites with double-height ceilings, and organic delicatessens selling squid ink pasta from Umbria and artisanal cheeses from Vermont.&nbsp; Everyone has been waiting for a similar metamorphosis to happen in Haverford.&nbsp; It hasn&#x2019;t been for want of trying: in 2004 a consortium of property speculators from away went crazy for the mill&#x2019;s exposed brickwork.&nbsp; An architect was commissioned to design a warren of luxury condominiums with reclaimed timber floors and glinting chrome appliances.&nbsp; But the town lacked the necessary real estate <i>mojo </i>to pull it off.&nbsp; No matter how pretty the artist&#x2019;s impressions in the brochure looked, nobody was buying.&nbsp; Not a single unit was sold, and the promised renovation never happened.&nbsp; The place has remained abandoned and deserted ever since.</p><p>The wrecking ball is swinging fiercely now, slicing through the air in ever more violent arcs.&nbsp; The crane operator begins to rotate the cabin, gradually turning it toward the old walls.&nbsp; I feel my body stiffen in anticipation of the first impact.&nbsp; When it comes, there is an infernal roar of collapsing brick, crushed wood, and splintering glass.&nbsp; That&#x2019;s when I feel a release within me, a quiet letting go.&nbsp; The crane operator edges the caterpillar tracks forward a few feet, and moments later another slab of wall disappears.&nbsp; A fog of atomized red brick hangs over the rubble.&nbsp; I watch for a few minutes, and then turn away.&nbsp; There is nothing more to see.&nbsp;</p><p>As I walk back over the bridge, I think about those two gravity-defying summers, almost forty years ago, when the old mill gave us shelter, and Nathan Tilly&#x2019;s gift for boundless hope gave us wings.&nbsp; Nathan loved the mill so much.&nbsp; Inside those old brick walls, the light of uncomplicated happiness shone down on us, as warm and as comforting as the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>But such a bright light casts long, dark shadows.</p><p>I open the door of my car and climb in.&nbsp; I rest my hands on the steering wheel and gaze back across the bridge.&nbsp; The wrecking ball is still swinging hard, making its way toward the mill&#x2019;s chimney.</p><p>I do not want to see the chimney fall.&nbsp; I drive away.</p><br><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>1976</b></p><br><p><b>ONE</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes life-changing moments slip by unnoticed, their significance only becoming apparent in the light of subsequent events.&nbsp; But Nathan Tilly was never one for the subtle approach.</p><p>The summer of 1976 had been long and humid.&nbsp; The horseflies had been larger and more vicious than in past years, which was saying something.&nbsp; They had swarmed around me, taking painful chunks out of my sweet, thirteen year-old flesh.&nbsp; My legs and upper body bore the scars of months of relentless attack.&nbsp; For me the smell of summer was not the salty tang of the ocean, nor the ambrosial scent of young blueberries, but the sour chemical whiff of antiseptic cream that my mother would slather on my bumpy mosaic of bites, a constellation of unending irritation.&nbsp; On the first day of my eighth grade year at Longfellow Middle School, my shoulders were still itching from the horseflies&#x2019; diabolical attention.&nbsp;</p><p>My discomfort was also, I am sure, a physical manifestation of the anxiety that I was feeling that day.&nbsp; I had been dreading the start of the new school year all summer.&nbsp; Every blissfully unscheduled day of vacation was, to me, just one step closer to seeing Hollis Calhoun again.</p><p>For most of the previous year, Hollis Calhoun had bullied me without mercy.&nbsp; He undertook a campaign of terrors, small and large.&nbsp; Some of it was innocuous enough &#x2013; an unanticipated cuff around the back of the head in the corridor, a sharp elbow jab to the ribs in the cafeteria line &#x2013; but he also liked to corner me out of sight of others, and inflict more elaborate, sustained cruelties.&nbsp; He crowded in on me, heavy and huge, obliterating the world beyond his fists.&nbsp; His violence was claustrophobic as well as cruel. There was a warped intimacy in all those carefully administered punches and kicks.&nbsp; He would scrutinize my face intently as he hurt me, delighted by the fear in my eyes.</p><p>For all his thuggery, Hollis possessed a nuanced understanding of the psychological mechanics of terror.&nbsp; He took care to ensure that his attacks were never predictable.&nbsp; Not knowing when they might come, I was in a constant state of high alert.&nbsp; Sometimes he would leave me alone for days, which had the paradoxical effect of ratcheting up my sense of impending dread.&nbsp; When I finally saw him lumbering toward me, I felt something oddly close to relief that the wait was over.&nbsp; The threat of Hollis Calhoun&#x2019;s fists that marauded across my fevered imagination was worse than any blow they could land in actuality.</p><p>There had been nothing I could do to make Hollis stop, since he didn&#x2019;t appear to want<i> </i>anything from me.&nbsp; My terror seemed to be an end unto itself.&nbsp; He never told me what I had done to deserve his attention, and always the same unanswered question would fog my panicked brain as he approached me with that malevolent look in his eye: <i>why me</i>?</p><p>Hollis was a year older than me, and I had consoled myself with the thought that at least he would be graduating to high school in the fall.&nbsp; Then, a week before the school year ended, Hollis had cornered me in the boys&#x2019; locker room.&nbsp; He pressed one side of my face into the cold floor, his knee in the small of my back, and told me that he was being held back a grade.&nbsp; He would be at Longfellow again next year.&nbsp; He banged my head against the tiles a couple of times, as if this was somehow my fault.&nbsp;</p><p>As I pushed open the door to my classroom, the prospect of seeing Hollis Calhoun again, combined with the ferocious itching beneath my shirt, had plunged me into my own universe of self-pity.&nbsp; I sat down at the nearest desk and opened my bag.&nbsp; As usual, my mother had left me a folded note.&nbsp; Her choice of quotation that day seemed especially apt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Lord is my helper; I will not fear.&nbsp; What can man do to me?</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Hebrews, 13:6</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>That was indeed the question.&nbsp; I had spent much of the last three months anxiously imagining what abominations Hollis had in mind for me.&nbsp; I looked up gloomily, and noticed an unfamiliar presence in the row ahead.&nbsp; Most of my classmates were already slumped in bored disaffection over their desks, but a new boy I did not recognize sat bolt upright in his chair.&nbsp; His hair was as black as the leather on my mother&#x2019;s Bible.&nbsp; He wore a green cable-knit turtleneck sweater, which looked insufferably hot on that warm morning.&nbsp; While I was surreptitiously examining him, he turned and looked right at me.&nbsp; Our eyes met for the briefest of moments, and then I looked away.&nbsp; New arrivals were to be treated with extreme caution until their position in the classroom pecking order could be calibrated.&nbsp; I bent down and pretended to look for something in my bag. &nbsp;The new boy didn&#x2019;t turn back around, though.&nbsp; He kept looking at me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The day dragged on impossibly slowly, but not slowly enough for me.&nbsp; As the hands on the clock above the blackboard crept toward the final bell, I could feel the fear rising in my throat.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as classes were over I ran to fetch my things, hoping for a quick escape, but Hollis Calhoun was already waiting for me, leaning against the door of my locker.&nbsp; To my dismay, he seemed to have grown even bigger over the summer.&nbsp; We looked at each other without speaking.&nbsp; There was nothing to be said. Hollis twisted my arm roughly behind my back and began to march me against the tide of students who were streaming toward the exit. The corridors became more deserted as we walked toward the back of the school.&nbsp; Like a nostalgic lover, Hollis was taking me back to one of our old haunts.&nbsp; He stopped in front of the boys&#x2019; locker room, and pushed me inside.&nbsp;</p><p>He grabbed my shirt and shoved me up against the wall, snapping my head backwards.&nbsp; The summer evaporated in an instant.&nbsp; Pinned there by his fists, it felt as if we had never been apart.&nbsp; Hollis was peering beadily at me.&nbsp; I averted my gaze and said nothing.&nbsp; After a moment he relaxed his grip, took a half step away from me, and put a ferocious knee into my thigh.&nbsp; I yelped and dropped to the ground.&nbsp; He pushed me over on to my back with his foot.&nbsp; Pain began to radiate across my lower body.&nbsp; Killer dead legs were a specialty of his.&nbsp; He held me down and went to work on my upper arms, pressing and pulling my skin into fat knots of pain.&nbsp; He found the worst of my horsefly bites and pinched them with brutal relish.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, this is just like old times, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he whispered.&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you ready for another year of fun?&#x201d;</p><p>Before I could answer Hollis hauled me to my feet and dragged me to the nearest cubicle.&nbsp; He flung open the door and pushed me inside. Still holding the collar of my shirt, he flipped up the lid of the toilet.&nbsp; He kicked the backs of my legs and I collapsed to my knees.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought we might try something new,&#x201d; said Hollis.&nbsp; He grabbed my hair and pushed my head into the toilet bowl.&nbsp; I just had time to take a deep breath before he pulled the chain.&nbsp; He held my head firmly in place as water sluiced through my mouth and up my nose. When he finally yanked me out of the bowl I sucked air into my lungs, and then started coughing.&nbsp; Hollis did not relinquish his grip on my collar.&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just getting started,&#x201d; he told me.&nbsp; To my disappointment, I felt the prickle of tears at the corners of my eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Just then there was a loud bang, and Hollis lurched into me.&nbsp; The door of the cubicle had been flung open.&nbsp; Standing there was the new boy from class that morning.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Let him go!&#x201d; he yelled.</p><p>Hollis and I were both too surprised to speak.&nbsp; Neither of us really wanted to be interrupted.&nbsp; Hollis was too busy enjoying himself, and I didn&#x2019;t want my humiliation made worse by a witness.&nbsp; As we stared at our intruder, he began kicking Hollis on the shins.&nbsp; In that tiny cubicle there was nowhere for Hollis to go.&nbsp; Laughing, he let go of me for a moment and tried to push the boy away.&nbsp; His attacker responded by stepping in closer and hammering his fists against Hollis&#x2019;s chest.&nbsp; He was no match for Hollis physically, but what he lacked in strength he made up for with sheer ferocity.&nbsp; The cubicle was crowded with the three of us squeezed in there.&nbsp; The new boy was by the door and I was still kneeling in front of the toilet bowl.&nbsp; Sandwiched between us, Hollis had no room to defend himself properly or mete out retribution.&nbsp; The boy stepped in to deliver another flurry of punches, which Hollis swatted away. He had stopped laughing by then.&nbsp; Now the fight was conducted almost entirely in silence.&nbsp; All I could hear was the boy&#x2019;s heavy breathing, and a few grunts from Hollis whenever a punch landed on target.&nbsp; I cowered on the floor, hoping not to be kicked.&nbsp; My head and shirt were soaking wet.&nbsp; The world beyond the cubicle vanished.&nbsp; The three of us were so focused on the strange, unequal struggle within its walls that we failed to hear the door of the locker room open.</p><p>The shout of anger that followed we heard well enough.</p><br><p><b>TWO</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ten minutes later, the three of us were sitting on a bench in a deserted school corridor.&nbsp; The janitor who had interrupted the fight had hauled us out of the cubicle, one by one, grabbing us by the scruffs of our necks like newborn kittens.&nbsp; Identifying Hollis Calhoun and the new boy as the principal antagonists, he had propelled them angrily in front of him toward the principal&#x2019;s office.&nbsp; I &#x2013; ob...</p></p><h2>Thicker Than Water (Heartland)</h2><p>Eleven years after her father deserted her, Amy must face the fact that he is coming to Heartland.

Bailey (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction - towards the time she acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, she took up her soul work and committed thirty years to the writing of the books that constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.</p><h2>The Horse in the Furrow</h2><p>The Suffolk Punch - that sturdy, compact draft horse of noble ancestry - was, until mechanisation, the powerhouse of the East Anglian farming community. In The Horse in the Furrow (1960), renowned social historian George Ewart Evans explores this potent symbol of a bygone era, and the complex network - farmer, horseman, groom, smith, harness-maker and tailor - which surrounded it. Evans charts a fascinating course, demonstrating the connectedness of husbandry, custom and dialect, and arguing for an organic, inclusive study of these aspects of rural life. In particular, the section on folklore sheds light on some of the most obscure practices, with the Punch standing proudly at its centre. With beautiful illustrations by Charles Tunnicliffe, The Horse in the Furrow is an engaging and subtle portrait of an animal at the heart of its community</p><p>Born in the mining town of Abercynon, South Wales, George Ewart Evans (1909-88) was a pioneering oral historian. In 1948 he settled with his family in Blaxhall, Suffolk, and through conversing with his neighbours he developed an interest in their dialect and the aspects of rural life which they described. Many were agricultural labourers, born before the turn of the century, who had worked on farms before the arrival of mechanisation. With the assistance of a tape recorder he collected oral evidence of the dialect, rural customs, traditions and folklore throughout East Anglia, and this work, reinforced by documental research, provided the background for his renowned East Anglian books.</p><h2>Garfield Hams It Up (Garfield #31)</h2><p>In his thirty-first book, American&#39;s foremost cartoon cat is showcased in scenes in which he is wolfing down food, playing mind games with his doggie pal Odie, and proving to his master Jon who is really the boss.

This battle was one of the most brutal and devastating engagements of the American Civil War, and the North&#x2019;s bloody victory there insured their triumph at Gettysburg, setting the stage for the South&#x2019;s ultimate defeat. Using newly discovered documents and rare firsthand sources, acclaimed historian Glenn LaFantasie sheds new light on the dramatic story of this pivotal battle and tells the story as it truly unfolded, from the perspective of the brave men who fought and died there.</p><p>THE BATTLE OF LITTLE ROUND TOP AS IT HAS NEVER BEFORE SEEN-THROUGH THE EYES OF THE SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT THERE <p> "Here is the real story of the epic fight for Little Round Top, shorn of the mythology long obscuring this pivotal Gettysburg moment. A vivid and eloquent book." -- Stephen W. Sears, author of "Gettysburg" </p><p> "Little Round Top has become iconic in Civil War literature and American memory. In the emotional recollection of our great war, if there was one speck on the landscape that decided a battle and the future of a nation, then surely this was it. The story of the July 2, 1863 struggle for that hill outside Gettysburg goes deeper into our consciousness than that, however. The men who fought for it then and there believed it to be decisive, and that is why they died for it. Glenn W. LaFantasie's "Twilight at Little Round Top" addresses that epic struggle, how those warriors felt then and later, and their physical and emotional attachment to a piece of ground that linked them forever with their nation's fate. This is military and social history at its finest." -- W.C. Davis, author of "Lincoln's Men" and "An Honorable Defeat" </p><p> "Few military episodes of the Civil War have attracted as much attention as the struggle for Little Round Top on the second day of Gettysburg. This judicious and engaging book navigates confidently through a welter of contradictory testimony to present a splendid account of the action. It also places events on Little Round Top, which often are exaggerated, within the broader sweep of the battle. All readers interested in the battle of Gettysburg will read this book with enjoyment and profit." -- Gary W. Gallagher, author of "TheConfederate War" </p><p> "In his beautifully written narrative, Glenn LaFantasie tells the story of the battle for Little Round Top from the perspective of the soldiers who fought and died in July 1863. Using well-chosen quotes from a wide variety of battle participants, TWILIGHT puts the reader in the midst of the fight-- firing from behind boulders with members of the 4th Alabama, running up the hillside into battle with the men of the 140th New York, and watching in horror as far too many men die. This book offers an elegy to the courage of those men, a meditation on the meaning of war, and a cautionary tale about the sacrifices nations ask of their soldiers and the causes for which those sacrifices are needed." -- Amy Kinsel, Winnrer of the 1993 Allan Nevins Prize for "From These Honored Dead: Gettysburg in American Culture" </p><p></p>On every battlefield, decisive ground can often determine which army will win and which will lose. In the Civil War, one of those decisive places was Little Round Top. In the late afternoon of July 2, 1863, thousands of men from the Confederacy' s Army of Northern Virginia and the Union' s Army of the Potomac struggled over this small parcel of terrain, many of them giving their lives in a heroic effort to capture or to defend the hill' s rocky slopes and summit. Now, acclaimed author Glenn LaFantasie sheds new light on this legendary battle by telling the story as it really happened, through the eyes of the courageous men who fought there. <p> Written by one of the most historians of the Civil War period. "Twilight at Little Round Top" uses the celebrated " Face of battle" technique to paint a vivid portrait of the second day' s fight at Gettysburg. Told through the experiences of both high-ranking officers and low-ranking privates, LaFantasie' s meticulously researched book is based on newly discovered documents as well as other rate firsthand sources-- some of which were mined for the first time from the Oates Family Papers and other private collections-- to reconstruct this decisive battle with the dramatic intensity. </p><p> "Twilight at Little Round Top" looks beyond the legendary exploits and heroic tales of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain-- who has become known as the savior of Little Round Top-- to offer piercing portraits of the other individuals who played a much more pivotal role on the hill, including young Porter Farley from Rochester, New York, who was eager to emancipate America' s slaves by putting his life onthe line in battle; Private Billy Jordan, whose family plantation in Alabama depended on slavery; surly and bearish Lieutenant General James Longstreet, blamed for the defeat at Gettysburg by generations of Southerners; and the Union' s Colonel Paddy O' Rorke, whose brave and cool performance on the battlefield belied a gentle and tender heart hidden beneath his Irish mettle. </p><p> Brimming with memorable stories of quick wits and formidable courage, "Twilight at Little Round Top" recounts one day in a brutally devastating war, where grim-faced soldiers gritted their teeth, braved thunder and flames, and flowed their officers' commands as much as human endurance allowed for the sake of their fluttering flags. </p><p></p></p><h2>America by the Yard: Cirkut Camera: Images from the Early Twentieth Century</h2><p><p><strong>An astonishing collection of early panoramic photographs, many up to 5 feet wide.</strong></p> This book is both a history of an unusual camera and a splendid display of its product. "Yard longs," as the Cirkut camera's huge panoramic photographs were called, caused a sensation after the camera's introduction in the early twentieth century. Cirkut cameras were used to record scenic vistas, epic events, and group photographs of conventioneers, workers, soldiers, and students. Here, with many foldouts that show the prints in their full glory, are such historic moments as the building of the Panama Canal, the sunken battleship <em>Maine</em> in Havana Harbor, the crash of the dirigible <em>Shenandoah</em>, the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, the 1908 Wellesley graduating class, and a very early race at the Indianapolis Speedway. More mundane subjects&#x2015;a bathing beauty contest, locomotive factory workers&#x2015;are equally fascinating in this format.

The method itself is surprisingly simple: breathe deeply and slowly, formulate specific questions, and trust God. She discusses characteristics of true guidance and ways to discern whether knowledge comes from wishful thinking or from interference by the lower self. The ultimate test seems to be whether guidance provides support and encouragement, or fear and negativity; she believes that the latter indicates false guidance.

But Sano's wife, Reiko, believes that Haru is innocent and that the real culprits are hiding behind the barred gates of the temple, home to a mysterious sect that is rumored to be responsible for a number of criminal acts. Under pressure to solve the crime, Sano agrees to let Reiko help, but when she takes matters into her own hands, it puts his career in jeopardy and nearly destroys their marriage. Who is the mysterious Abbess of the Black Lotus, and what is the sect's real goal? Is Haru the innocent youngster Reiko believes her to be, or does the evidence Sano uncovers reveal her deceitful nature and complicity in the murders of a child, a young woman, and a high-ranking police commander?

These collected interviews reveal her to be much more. She has shared space in her creative life for her career in publishing, in teaching, and in being a single parent. Writing, however, is one thing she &#x201c;refuses to live without.&#x201d; These interviews beginning in 1974 reveal an artist whose creativity is intimately linked with her African American experience and is fueled by cultural and societal concerns. For twenty years she has created unforgettable characters in her acclaimed novels&#x2015;<i>The Bluest Eye</i>, <i>Sula</i>, <i>Song of Solomon</i>, <i>Tar Baby</i>, <i>Beloved</i>, and <i>Jazz</i>. Morrison tells her interviewers that her goal as a writer is to present African American life not as sociology but in the full range of its depth, magic, and humanity. &#x201c;I want my work to capture the vast imagination of black people,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;That is, I want my books to reflect the imaginative combination of the real world, the very practical, shrewd, day-to-day functioning that black people do, while at the same time they encompass some great supernatural element.&#x201d; Though the scope and the magnitude of her art have brought her international acclaim, even some of her most ardent admirers have viewed her fiction mainly with a focus on class, race, and gender. In these interviews, however, she addresses the artist's concern with moral vision and with a resistance to critical attitudes that categorize black writing largely as sociology. From these interviews comes a greater understanding of Toni Morrison's purpose and the theme of love that streams through her fiction.</p><p><p>This is a collection of interviews, beginning in 1974, with Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Environmental pollution and disease-causing germs assault us continually day after day. Our food is nutrient deficient and our water supply dangerously contaminated. People today are exposed to chemicals in far greater concentrations than were previous generations. Diseases that were rare or unheard of a century ago are now raging upon us like a plague. Millions are dying from diseases that were virtually unknown in the past. Experts tell us that by the time we reach middle age, each one of us will have already been affected by either cancer, cardiovascular disease, or some other serious degenerative condition. Conventional medicine has no sure cure. Drugs, surgery, and radiation treatments can be as dangerous and debilitating as the diseases they attempt to cure. This book outlines the steps you need to take to thoroughly detoxify and cleanse your body from these disease-causing agents. You will also learn how to reduce your toxic exposure and how to strengthen your immune system.</p><p>Substances that are toxic to our bodies come at us from all directions: the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink, the cleaning products we use, and the metabolic waste produced inside us. Toxins build up in the body faster than they can be removed, contributing to premature aging and chronic and degenerative diseases.

We believe in one God, not three." <p>"God doesn't have a son." </p><p>"Jews don't believe in a suffering Messiah." </p><p>In Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus, volume 2, Michael Brown provides real answers to twenty-eight theological objections. He treats these objections seriously and fairly, building answers from the often surprising teachings in Rabbinic literature and the Hebrew Scriptures. As Brown's answers progressively reveal, belief in Yeshua-Jesus-is not something alien to Jewish tradition but is profoundly rooted in that tradition, fulfilling its purpose. </p><p>"Michael Brown's thinking is incisive and to the point. His ability to explain so that anyone can understand is amazing. He will surely be acclaimed as the new expert in Jewish Christian apologetics. I would be happy to recommend his much needed book to anyone." -Moishe Rosen, founder, Jews for Jesus </p><p>"We desperately need this book!" -Sid Roth, founder and president, Messianic Vision </p><p>"Michael Brown's work in the area of Jewish apologetics is the most thorough and penetrating I have seen. . . .

This man is the seeker rather than the sage; he records the turmoil, struggle, and questioning that preceded the serene and confident affirmations of the essays. He is honest, earthy, tough-minded, self-critical ("I am a lover of indolence, &amp; of the belly"), warm in his enthusiasms, a witty and sharp observer of people and events. Everything is grist for his mill: personal experiences, his omnivorous reading, ruminations on matters large and small, his doubts and perplexities, public issues and local gossip. There are abrupt shifts in subject and tone, reflecting the variousness of his moods and the restless energy of his mind. </p><p> Drawing from Harvard's sixteen-volume scholarly edition of the journals--but omitting the textual apparatus that makes it hard to read--Joel Porte presents a sympathetic selection that brings us close to Emerson the man. </p></p><p>This long-awaited volume offers the general reader the heart of Emerson&#39;s journals, that extraordinary series of diaries and notebooks in which he poured out his thoughts for more than fifty years.</p><h2>Karl Marx: His Life and Thought</h2><p>Marx&#39;s private relationships and political and intellectual development are reviewed in detail</p><p></p><h2>Como Agua Para Chocolate (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Earthy, magical, and utterly charming, this tale of family life in turn-of-the-century Mexico became a best-selling phenomenon with its winning blend of poignant romance and bittersweet wit.

During World War II he was captured following service in North Africa and Italy, and his prisoner-of-war experiences later leading to the writing of the acclaimed novel &#39;Death in Captivity&#39; in 1952.After the war, Gilbert worked as a solicitor in London, but his writing continued throughout his legal career and in addition to novels he wrote stage plays and scripts for radio and television. He is, however, best remembered for his novels, which have been described as witty and meticulously-plotted espionage and police procedural thrillers, but which exemplify realism.HRF Keating stated that &#39;Smallbone Deceased&#39; was amongst the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. &#34;The plot,&#34; wrote Keating, &#34;is in every way as good as those of Agatha Christie at her best: as neatly dovetailed, as inherently complex yet retaining a decent credibility, and as full of cunningly-suggested red herrings.&#34; It featured Chief Inspector Hazlerigg, who went on to appear in later novels and short stories, and another series was built around Patrick Petrella, a London based police constable (later promoted) who was fluent in four languages and had a love for both poetry and fine wine. Other memorable characters around which Gilbert built stories included Calder and Behrens. They are elderly but quite amiable agents, who are nonetheless ruthless and prepared to take on tasks too much at the dirty end of the business for their younger colleagues. They are brought out of retirement periodically upon receiving a bank statement containing a code.Much of Michael Gilbert&#39;s writing was done on the train as he travelled from home to his office in London: &#34;I always take a latish train to work,&#34; he explained in 1980, &#34;and, of course, I go first class. I have no trouble in writing because I prepare a thorough synopsis beforehand.&#34;. After retirement from the law, however, he nevertheless continued and also reviewed for &#39;The Daily Telegraph&#39;, as well as editing &#39;The Oxford Book of Legal Anecdotes&#39;. Gilbert was appointed CBE in 1980. Generally regarded as &#39;one of the elder statesmen of the British crime writing fraternity, he was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers&#39; Association and in 1988 he was named a Grand Master by the MystMerits serious consideration as a work of art.--The New York Times Book Review</p><h2>The Breast Cancer Cookbook: Over 100 Easy Recipes to Nourish and Boost Health During and After Treatment</h2><p>Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women during their lifetimes.

He is the author of <em>The Emperor's New Mind</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and was awarded the UK's 1990 COPUS Prize for science writing. In 1988, he received the internationally prestigious Wolf Prize for physics, shared with Stephen Hawking, for their joint contribution to our understanding of the universe.<br>A leading critic of artificial intelligence research returns to the attack, attempting to lay the groundwork for an analysis of the true nature of intelligence. Building on his arguments in The Emperor's New Mind (not reviewed), Penrose (Mathematics/Oxford) begins by refuting the assertion that true intelligence can be attained--or even adequately simulated--by the strictly computational means to which current computers are ultimately limited. Much of his argument depends closely on the application of G&#x201d;del's Undecidability Theorem to Turing machines--deep waters for laypeople, although the fundamentals of his argument are accessible to readers without sophisticated mathematical training. Having disposed of the central tenets of current AI research, Penrose then turns to an even more fundamental question: the actual foundations in modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum theory) of the phenomenon of consciousness. Here much of his summary depends on fairly complex mathematical reasoning, although the key points are summarized for the general reader who has been willing to follow him so far. Penrose feels that a new physical synthesis, reconciling the paradoxes of quantum theory and bringing them into harmony with Einstein's gravitational theories, is ultimately necessary to explain the noncomputational elements of consciousness and intelligence. He speculates on the possible role of cellular structures called microtubules in creating a quantum phenomenon on a macroscopic scale within the brain, but grants that more research is needed to establish any connection between physical and mental phenomena. His conclusion steps back to a philosophical overview of the subject, paying homage to Plato, among others. A challenging examination of a central problem of modern philosophy, with no final answers but plenty of food for thought.

The other three streets either lead downtown or to shortcuts to the south side. But Baker falls off a slight embankment, part of a closed loop bordering a large empty field near the Whetstone Brook &#x2014; out of sight and largely out of mind.</p> <p>The buildings along it run from decrepit to slightly better, in varying stages. The address Don Matthews had given me was a two-story apartment building, once a home, now cut into four small, dark sections, each one neglected, stagnant, but cheap. The windows were all covered with familiar brittle and tattered plastic wrap, once put up to help stop the freezing air from whistling through the gaps, but left to age through all four seasons, year after year, until its only remaining effectiveness was to proclaim the hopelessness of those barely sheltered behind it.</p> <p>Willy and I had decided on a quiet approach, parking up the street and coming around the corner on foot. The weather was good &#x2014; clear, sharp, and cold enough to make your nose hairs tingle &#x2014; and I didn&#x2019;t mind the chance, however oddly presented, to be outside and away from the stifling indoor heat most people found comforting during the winter.</p> <p>We walked down the middle of the street. There was no traffic, and the sidewalks had been left to reemerge in the spring, typical of most of the town&#x2019;s less stringently tidy neighborhoods.</p> <p>&#x201c;Anything we should know about Jorja Duval?&#x201d; I asked Willy as the house loomed nearer.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothing you couldn&#x2019;t guess,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;On welfare, on drugs, small history of dealing, tricking, and petty theft. Featured in a few domestics, according to Bratt PD, always as the punching bag. I knew her father back in the old days. Always figured he was banging her, although no charges were ever brought. He&#x2019;s at St. Albans now on a manslaughter charge. Jorja had a brother, too, but he OD&#x2019;d about five years ago.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How old is she?&#x201d;</p> <p>Willy hesitated. &#x201c;Twenty-five? Maybe younger.&#x201d;</p> <p>We drew abreast of the house, took it in quickly with a practiced eye, and then struggled our way up a pathway that had been cleared in the Walter Skottick fashion &#x2014; not at all.</p> <p>The peeling front door sported four rusty mailboxes by its side, none of them labeled. There were also no doorbells. I raised an inquiring eye at Willy.</p> <p>He pointed to the window above us and to the right. &#x201c;That one,&#x201d; He said softly, and twisted the doorknob.</p> <p>The door swung back to reveal a gloomy, barefloored hallway with a set of stairs heading up. The odorous fog that crept out to envelope us was rancid and flavored with mildew and a smell of humanity reminiscent of an overripe diaper pail. Neither one of us reacted, since as working environments went, this was pretty standard fare.</p> <p>We both paused for a moment, watching and listening, taking nothing for granted, knowing full well that inhabitants of such places were capable of anything.</p> <p>Hearing nothing, we headed upstairs. There was an extra stillness to the cold air I didn&#x2019;t like, though, and I could sense Willy felt the same way. He unbuttoned his coat, and removed his gun from its holster.</p> <p>Walking on the balls of our feet to partially muffle our shoes and the squeaking of old floor boards, we moved to either side of Jorja Duval&#x2019;s apartment door and paused once again, listening to nothing but our own breathing.</p> <p>I finally reached out and rapped on the door, looking up and down the hallway as I did so for any movement from the other two apartments on the landing. &#x201c;Jorja Duval? This is the police. Open up.&#x201d;</p> <p>The response was immediate, otherworldly, and psychologically chilling. From inside, we heard a single, high-pitched animal howl, followed by a series of thuds, crashes, and the sound of claws scrabbling across bare wood at high speed. It was as if my knock had unleashed some demonic pin ball that was now smacking off every wall and obstacle inside the apartment.</p> <p>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; I muttered, and grasped the door knob, twisting it slowly.</p> <p>The door opened and a tabby cat flew out and froze for a split second at the sight of us, its hair on end, before shooting off like a rocket down the stairs. But not before I&#x2019;d seen that all four of its paws were crusty with dried blood.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; Willy burst out, his hand tight on the gun.</p> <p>Still recovering from the surprise, I chanced a fast glance around the corner, my own gun out as well. Pulling my head back, I described what I&#x2019;d seen to Willy. &#x201c;Short hall, two closed doors opposite each other. Big room beyond. All I could see there were two legs sticking into the middle of a big blood stain, and red paw prints all over the place.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We call for backup?&#x201d; he asked.</p> <p>I paused, thinking of the eerie stillness I&#x2019;d noticed earlier. &#x201c;No time. Ready on three?&#x201d;</p> <p>I held up three fingers, one at a time, and the two of us entered the small hallway as one, covering both the distant room and the two closed doors.</p> <p>The precautions proved unnecessary. The place was empty except for the dead woman in the middle of the floor, lying face up, spread-eagle, with her throat cut wide. The room was dingy, dark, barely furnished, splotched with blood, and seemed far less comfortable than the average coffin.</p> <p>&#x201c;This Jorja Duval?&#x201d; I asked Willy.</p> <p>He holstered his weapon. &#x201c;Was.&#x201d;</p> (Archer Mayor)</p><h2>The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer (Great Discoveries)</h2><p><b>The story of the persecuted genius who helped create the modern computer.</b><br><br>To solve one of the great mathematical problems of his day, Alan Turing proposed an imaginary programmable calculating machine. But the idea of actually producing a "Turing machine" did not crystallize until he and his brilliant Bletchley Park colleagues built devices to crack the Nazis' Enigma code, thus ensuring the Allies' victory in World War II. In so doing, Turing became a champion of artificial intelligence, formulating the famous (and still unbeaten) Turing Test that challenges our ideas of human consciousness. But Turing's postwar computer-building was cut short when, as an openly gay man in a time when homosexuality was officially illegal in England, he was apprehended by the authorities and sentenced to a "treatment" that amounted to chemical castration, leading to his suicide.<br><br>With a novelist's sensitivity, David Leavitt portrays Turing in all his humanity&#x2014;his eccentricities, his brilliance, his fatal candor&#x2014;while elegantly explaining his work and its implications.</p><p><b>David Leavitt</b> is the author of several novels, including most recently <i>The Body of Jonah Boyd</i>, and story collections. He teaches creative writing at the University of Florida, Gainesville, where he lives.Twenty-five years ago the word "Turing" tingled with mystery for the few who knew it. Readers of Douglas Hofstadter learned that Alan Turing belonged with G�del in exploring minds and logic and knew also of "the Turing test" for artificial intelligence. But others were aware of Turing as a British figure, a Cambridge mathematician, emerging in connection with the huge World War II operation to break the Enigma ciphers. His crucial importance in the battle of the Atlantic was still shrouded by state secrecy. In fact, it was only after this secrecy was lifted that he began to be acknowledged for another great contribution&#x2014;his role in the origin of the computer. The conspicuously missing feature was the testimony of Alan Turing himself. He had died at age 41 in 1954, apparently killing himself with cyanide&#x2014; and leaving a jagged hole in history. By 1980 rumor told of the prosecution and punishment that he had undergone as a homosexual in 1952. But even then, such a story could no longer serve as a simple explanation of suicide. Turing&#x2019;s friends had known him as unashamed and contemptuous of convention. A different suspicion struck those who knew the dark side of the 1950s. The victorious Allies must have been appalled by this revelation of the man who knew their secrets: How could Turing&#x2019;s private desires be reconciled with the public demands of state security? But on this question, total silence reigned. Since then, the situation has completely changed. A number of events have made Turing&#x2019;s life better known to the public than that of probably any other mathematician. A notable actor, Derek Jacobi, has played Turing&#x2019;s drama to millions of viewers in Hugh Whitemore&#x2019;s 1986 play Breaking the Code. Little is secret from Google, and computer science students may find themselves expected to assess his life and death. Massive U.S. government releases in the 1990s have made World War II code breaking the subject of detailed scholarship, and conferences and books celebrate Turing&#x2019;s continuing influence. Complexity theory and quantum computing build on his analysis of computation, and since the 1980s Roger Penrose has given new life to Turing&#x2019;s deepest questions. Above all, Turing&#x2019;s reputation is now solidly underpinned by the vindication of his vision. Although John von Neumann led by a few months in creating a computer plan, it was Turing who explained in 1946 how "every known process" could be turned into computer software. Turing had seen this prospect in the simple but revolutionary principle of his Universal Turing Machine, laid out in a paper in 1936, and had thus created an amazing link between the purest mathematics and the most productive industrial applications. But there are always more secrets to unravel and always room for yet another introduction. A series of "great discoveries," such as the current undertaking from W. W. Norton, cannot ignore Turing, and it is interesting to see the story of his contributions attempted by an American novelist, David Leavitt. The story is not simply a question of dates and facts. To use one of Turing&#x2019;s own images, it is like the skin of an onion. It calls for a writer who can unpeel it with care and who is unafraid of tears. Intensely private, yet relishing popular writing and broadcasts, fiercely proud and yet absurdly self-effacing, Turing led a strange life intertwined with characteristically odd British puzzles of class and lifestyle. A central paradox is that he asserted the "heretical theory" that the human mind could be rivaled by a computer, whereas his own personality so little resembled the output of a machine. It was willful, individualistic, unpredictable. His struggle to incorporate initiative and creativity in his artificial-intelligence theory is therefore a personal drama. This is a puzzle that goes to the heart of science and yet is also fine material for a novelist of insight. Leavitt&#x2019;s focus is elsewhere, however. It is on Turing as the gay outsider, driven to his death. No opportunity is lost to highlight this subtext. When Turing quips about the principle of "fair play for machines," Leavitt sees a plea for homosexual equality. It is quite right to convey his profound alienation and to bring out the consistency of his English liberalism. It is valuable to show human diversity lying at the center of scientific inquiry. But Leavitt&#x2019;s laborious decoding understates the constant dialogue between subjective individual vision and the collective work of mathematics and science, with its ideal of objectivity, to which Turing gave his life. Scientific content is not neglected; Leavitt&#x2019;s discussion of Turing&#x2019;s 1936 paper has perhaps excessive technical detail. But the vision is partial: he fails to give any discussion of what Turing&#x2019;s proof implies for the question of artificial intelligence. A general problem is that, being the prisoner of secondary sources, the author finds himself the outsider. He quotes from another writer on statistical methods in 19th-century code breaking but omits the primary fact that Turing&#x2019;s central scientific contribution at Bletchley Park, the British wartime cryptanalytic center, was his statistical theory of weighing evidence. The book&#x2019;s subtitle is "Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer," but on the critical question of Turing&#x2019;s relationship with von Neumann it must rely on quoting Martin Davis&#x2019;s Engines of Logic. This is no groundbreaking book, nor does it do much hoeing or weeding. It is a survey of a field long cultivated by other hands, devoid of new witnesses. The title, also secondhand, suggests new light on his death, but there are no new facts. Leavitt claims a "sad descent into grief and madness" induced by the prosecution&#x2014;he ignores the heap of manuscripts from Turing&#x2019;s last prolific year of research and misrepresents his renewed interest in physics as ravings. No new revelation about Turing&#x2019;s code breaking is offered. Leavitt describes his visit to Bletchley Park&#x2014;now a museum&#x2014;but only as a tourist, to report the embarrassment of a tour guide in describing Turing&#x2019;s fate. In this book, Leavitt offers his own tour. It is one that many will find congenial and that will at least introduce new readers to the still tingling enigma of Alan Turing. <p><i>Andrew Hodges, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, is author of Alan Turing: The Enigma (1983).</i></p></p><h2>The Trilogy of Two</h2><p><p><b>A <i>TIME</i> Magazine Top 10 Children's Book of 2015<br></b><br><b>&#x201c;<i>The Trilogy of Two</i> is full of inventiveness, with a world that&#x2019;s constructed ingeniously and characters who are vivid and attractive.&#x201d;&#x2014;Philip Pullman, author of His Dark Materials</b><br><br>Identical twins Sonja and Charlotte are musical prodigies with extraordinary powers.

Summary; This biography covers Hardy's illegitimate birth, his rural upbringing, his escape to London in the 1860s, his marriages, his status as a bestselling novelist, and in later life, his supreme achievements as a poet. Thomas Hardy is one of the sacred figures in English writing, a great poet and a novelist with a world reputation. His life was also extraordinary: from the poverty of rural Dorset he went on to become the Grand Old Man of English life and letters, his last resting place in Westminster Abbey. This seminal biography, by our leading biographer, covers Hardy's illegitimate birth, his rural upbringing, his escape to London in the 1860s, his marriages, his status as a bestselling novelist, and in later life, his supreme achievements as a poet.

Biography &amp; autobiography: literary.</p><p>Claire Tomalin was literary editor of the New Statesman and Sunday Times. She has published a collection of journalism and is the author of seven highly acclaimed biographies, including: The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft (Whitbread First Book Prize); The Invisible Woman: The Story of Nelly Ternan and Charles Dickens (Hawthornden Prize, the NCR Book Award and James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Biography); and Pepys: The Unequalled Self (Whitbread Book of the Year).Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley<p>In the summer of 1926, Thomas Hardy was visited at his house in Dorset by Leonard and Virginia Woolf, she being "the daughter of his old editor Leslie Stephen." Hardy, Claire Tomalin reports in this new biography, had read nothing of hers, although she had published several novels, most recently Mrs. Dalloway. Neither of the Woolfs was offended by this. Instead, both came away charmed by "his freedom, ease and vitality," Virginia wrote in her diary, and a year and a half later, not long after Hardy's death, Leonard published a tribute to him and his work, which he summarized as "in the full English tradition, solid works built about a story, in which, on the face of it, character, humour, description of scenery, criticism of life, philosophy, all have their place, but to which they are accessory," a body of work that added up to "a great novel and a great work of art." As to the man himself: </p><p>"This impression of simplicity and of something which is almost the opposite of simplicity was the strongest impression which I got from Hardy personally. At first sight, and when he began to talk to you, you might have thought that he was merely one of many men born in English villages. But he is one of the few people who have left upon me the personal impression of greatness. I saw him . . . in the house which he had built for himself at Dorchester, and which, with its sombre growth of trees, seemed to have been created by him as if it were one of his poems translated into brick, furniture and vegetation. He talked about his poems, and London as he had known it in his youth, and about his dog 'Wessex', all with great charm and extraordinary simplicity. He was a human being, not 'the great man.' "</p><p>It is one of the many strengths of Claire Tomalin's biography that she conveys in full Hardy's simple humanity. Obviously he was not a simple man as the term is ordinarily used -- indeed, the days of his long life were filled with complexity -- but he retained to the end an almost childlike fascination with and love for the quotidian world, which no doubt goes a long way toward explaining why, eight decades after his death, his work remains beloved and widely read. His novels and poems fall in and out of literary fashion, but they never fall out of print. He was not an unduly graceful prose stylist, and he tended to throw more into a novel than it could sustain, but, as Tomalin writes, his work is "full of curious and arresting perceptions, sublime moments, wilful and tragic men and women who impose themselves by their originality and their vivid human presence." </p><p>Hardy's life story has been written many times -- by Michael Millgate and Ralph Pite most recently -- and Hardy himself wrote a two-volume autobiography in collaboration with his second wife, Florence, which was published after his death. Tomalin brings to the task the skills of an experienced and accomplished biographer -- among her previous subjects are Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Austen and Samuel Pepys -- and the confidence of a deeply informed literary critic. Her prose is fluid, and she can see her subject's strengths and weaknesses clearly but sympathetically. </p><p>Whenever a biographer decides to take on a person whose life has been written many times, invariably and perhaps inevitably an attempt is made to separate oneself from the crowd. Tomalin's attempt to do this -- so at least I interpret it -- is to emphasize Hardy's poetry. She begins with the death of his first wife, Emma, in 1912. She had been ill for some time, and the life had gone out of their marriage years before, but Tomalin argues that her death was "the moment when Thomas Hardy became a great poet." He was "filled with sorrow and remorse for their estrangement" and "began at once to revisit their early love in his mind with an intensity that expressed itself in a series of poems." Tomalin writes: </p><p>"In these poems about Emma he is rediscovering repressed sorrow and forgotten love. He is like an archaeologist uncovering objects that have not been seen for many decades, bringing them out into the light, examining them, some small pieces, some curious bones and broken bits, and some shining treasures. There is a rising excitement in the writing as of someone making discoveries. He has found the most perfect subject he has ever had, and he has the skills to work on it." </p><p>This is a biographical judgment that rings true but a literary judgment with which I must respectfully take issue. To me, Hardy's "most perfect subject" was Wessex, the fictionalized Dorset that is the setting for virtually all of his fiction, most notably his five greatest novels, Far From the Madding Crowd, The Return of the Native, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure. Hardy's poetry, though full of lovely moments, has never resonated with me the way these novels do, so the weight Tomalin accords it strikes me as excessive. </p><p>But this is a literary judgment. Though there are objective ways to measure literary accomplishment, they fall far short of the scientific and ultimately are subjective. What matters most about Tomalin's biography is the care with which she traces all of Hardy's writing to its roots in his own life. Her study reminds us that though a knowledge of a writer's life is unnecessary to an appreciation of his or her work, that knowledge can help us understand that work and its sources. </p><p>Hardy was born in Dorset in 1840 to a husband and wife of modest means. His father was a builder, kind and patient with a frail boy; his mother was "strong-minded and intelligent" and encouraged him to rise above his class at a time when class lines in England were rigidly drawn and almost impossible to cross. As a youth, he was deeply stung in church (a place he disliked) when the minister denounced people who were ambitious to rise in station, and this resentment stayed with him long after he had done precisely that. It is a persistent theme in his writing, the novels especially; other important themes include the ways of life of ordinary people, the injustices to which they regularly are subjected, the natural beauty with which they are surrounded, the country roads along which they walk: "The road became a theatre for action in his imagination and walking a central activity in his writing, used dramatically and to establish or underline character." By the 1870s, with the!</p><p> publication of The Return of the Native, he brought all this together. Henry James called the novel "second rate," but he was wrong: </p><p>"He was wrong because Hardy had found a true voice, sometimes awkward but tuned into experiences and feelings outside the range of Henry James. It is a voice that speaks to readers in many countries and to which successive generations have responded. With this voice Hardy established the territory in which he worked best in fiction, in which rural landscape is drawn with a naturalist's eye and country people are shown playing out their lives 'between custom and education, between work and ideas, between love of place and experience of change'. From now on all his best novels . . . were built on this foundation." </p><p>Those novels made him rich beyond anything he could have imagined and famous around the world. Though he never entered the aristocracy, he was on close terms with many members of it, who scurried to be in his company as the aura of his �clat grew ever brighter and wider. He was well aware, though, of how quickly and cruelly the upper classes could strike against their ostensible inferiors. In 1870, when he began courting Emma Gifford, her parents rejected him out of hand and refused to be present when they finally married four years later. In its early years, the marriage was reasonably happy, but husband and wife gradually drew apart; she enjoyed the fruits of his wealth and fame but thought she should get greater credit for her contributions to his work than she was given (or deserved), and he was so preoccupied with his work that he was frequently inattentive and distant. By the time of her death, he was in love with the much younger Florence Dugdale, though, as Toma!</p><p> lin says, he felt the loss of Emma deeply, which Florence (understandably) came to resent. </p><p>What Hardy lived for was his work. "From very early he began to make life into art, by seeing the special quality of natural occurrences and by dramatizing and embellishing them," but though he clearly had a calling to write he also went about it with supreme professionalism. He usually published serially and "suffered from bowdlerizing editors throughout his writing career," but he "understood the business side of writing, the importance of serialization, and how to deal with the American market, and the Australian, as well as British publishers and magazine editors." </p><p>He was not too proud to write for the market and accede to its demands, though when he prepared serials for book publication he put back material editors had removed and edited to suit his own standards rather than theirs. Among the many useful things his life and work tell us is that professionalism is not the enemy of art, but its agent and handmaiden.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

During World War II he was captured following service in North Africa and Italy, and his prisoner-of-war experiences later leading to the writing of the acclaimed novel &#39;Death in Captivity&#39; in 1952. After the war, Gilbert worked as a solicitor in London, but his writing continued throughout his legal career and in addition to novels he wrote stage plays and scripts for radio and television. He is, however, best remembered for his novels, which have been described as witty and meticulously-plotted espionage and police procedural thrillers, but which exemplify realism. HRF Keating stated that &#39;Smallbone Deceased&#39; was amongst the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. &#34;The plot,&#34; wrote Keating, &#34;is in every way as good as those of Agatha Christie at her best: as neatly dovetailed, as inherently complex yet retaining a decent credibility, and as full of cunningly-suggested red herrings.&#34; It featured Chief Inspector Hazlerigg, who went on to appear in later novels and short stories, and another series was built around Patrick Petrella, a London based police constable (later promoted) who was fluent in four languages and had a love for both poetry and fine wine. Other memorable characters around which Gilbert built stories included Calder and Behrens. They are elderly but quite amiable agents, who are nonetheless ruthless and prepared to take on tasks too much at the dirty end of the business for their younger colleagues. They are brought out of retirement periodically upon receiving a bank statement containing a code. Much of Michael Gilbert&#39;s writing was done on the train as he travelled from home to his office in London: &#34;I always take a latish train to work,&#34; he explained in 1980, &#34;and, of course, I go first class. I have no trouble in writing because I prepare a thorough synopsis beforehand.&#34;. After retirement from the law, however, he nevertheless continued and also reviewed for &#39;The Daily Telegraph&#39;, as well as editing &#39;The Oxford Book of Legal Anecdotes&#39;. Gilbert was appointed CBE in 1980. Generally regarded as &#39;one of the elder statesmen of the British crime writing fraternity&#39;, he was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers&#39; Association and in 1988 he was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, before receiving the Lifetime &#39;Anthony&#39; Achievement award at the 1990 Boucheron in London. Michael Gilbert died in 2006, aged ninety three, and was survived by his wife and their two sons and five daughters.</p><h2>Poverty of Historicism</h2><p>Karl Popper&#39;s The Poverty of Historicism is one of the most important books on the social sciences to have appeared since the Second World War. It is also the work of one of the most original minds of the twentieth century. At the time of its first publication in 1957, it was hailed by Arthur Koestler as &#39;probably the only book published this year which will outlive the century.&#39; A devastating criticism of the idea that there are fixed laws in history and that human beings are able to predict them, Popper dedicated the book to all those &#39;who fell victim to the fascist and communist belief in Inexorable Laws of Historical Destiny.&#39; Short and beautifully written, it has inspired generations of intellectuals, policy makers and general readers alike and remains one of the best books for gaining an insight into the ideas of this great thinker.</p><p><strong>Karl Popper</strong> (1902-94). Philosopher, born in Vienna. One of the most influential and controversial thinkers of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Monkey (The Five Ancestors, Book 2)</h2><p>At 11-years-old, Malao is the youngest of the Five Ancestors. Master of the monkey fighting style, he&#x2019;s curious and quick, fast and fun-loving. But now, with the destruction of the temple and the deaths of his older brothers and Grandmaster, Malao the fun-loving monkey is forced to face things he&#x2019;d rather not. As he grapples with these new and unwelcome feelings, Malao has an encounter with a dangerous band of bandits, is adopted by a troop of monkeys commanded by a one-eyed albino, and hears tantalizing rumors of a mysterious recluse called the Monkey King, who is said to act, and look, a lot like him. . . .<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Jeff Stone practices the martial arts daily. He has worked as a photographer, an editor, a maintenance man, a technical writer, a ballroom dance instructor, a concert promoter, and a marketing director for companies that design schools, libraries, and skateboard parks. Like the heroes of The Five Ancestors series, Mr. Stone was adopted when he was an infant. He began searching for his birthmother when he was 18; he found her 15 years later. The author lives with his wife and two children in Carmel, IN.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Chapter 1<br>Malao raced through the moonlit treetops, nervous energy driving him deeper and deeper into the forest. <br>He had to put as much distance between himself and Cangzhen Temple as possible. Ying had returned&#x2013;<br>and was more dangerous than ever.<br><br>Malao leaped off the gnarled arm of an ancient oak and soared through the night sky.<br><br>He landed on the limb of a young maple and paused. He was lucky to be alive, let alone to have escaped <br>uninjured. The same was true for his brothers Fu, Seh, Hok, and Long. Cangzhen Temple was in ruins, <br>and its warrior monks--Malao's older brothers and teachers--were all dead.<br><br>Malao began to tremble. The thunder he had heard was a devastating new weapon called a qiang. With <br>the twitch of a single finger, a soldier with no training at all could now kill a kung fu master. Ying carried a <br>qiang, and with it the power of a dragon. Still, that hadn't been enough for Ying. He had carved his face <br>and filled the grooves with green pigment. He had forked his tongue and ground his teeth and nails into <br>sharp points. Ying now looked like a dragon. A crazy, vengeful sixteen-year-old dragon.<br><br>Malao shuddered and grabbed hold of a thick vine. He pushed off the slender maple and swung feetfirst <br>toward a large elm.<br><br>"Scatter into the four winds and uncover Ying's secrets, as well as your own," Grandmaster had told them. <br>"Uncover the past, for it is your future."<br><br>Malao released the vine and somersaulted onto one of the elm's upper limbs. Why did Grandmaster hide <br>only us five? he wondered. What makes us so special?<br><br>Grandmaster had provided only one clue. He'd said that Malao and his four brothers were linked to each <br>other, and to Ying. Malao guessed it had something to do with the fact that all of them, including Ying, <br>were orphans. Still, that didn't explain much. It wasn't like any of them could have had the same parents. <br>They were all too different.<br><br>Malao glanced down at his small, dark hands. He was a monkey-style kung fu master, nothing at all like <br>Fu, the oversized, over-aggressive twelve-year-old "tiger," or Seh, the tall, secretive twelve-year-old <br>"snake." He differed even more from Hok, the pale-skinned, logical twelve-year-old "crane," and Long, the <br>wise, muscular thirteen-year-old "dragon."<br><br>Malao sighed. He missed them already.<br><br>A twig snapped and Malao froze. He glanced around but couldn't see anything from high in the tree. <br>Cautiously, he swung down to the elm's lowest limb for a closer look. He peeked through a clump of new <br>foliage and his heart skipped a beat. This part of the forest looked awfully familiar. His plan had been to <br>travel in a straight line away from the temple, but he'd always been really bad with directions--<br><br>Another twig snapped.<br><br>Malao crouched low on the large limb and held his breath. A moment later, he saw a soldier on patrol. One <br>of Ying's soldiers.<br><br>Malao shivered. He'd run in a big circle, and now he was right back where he'd started, near Cangzhen!<br><br>The soldier was headed in Malao's direction. Malao watched him closely. Heavy armor covered the man's <br>body, and he carried a short wooden stick about as long as Malao's arm. Malao got a good look at the <br>stick as the soldier passed through a pool of moonlight. The stick was nearly as big around as a monk's <br>staff and was made from a very light-colored wood, white waxwood. The entire surface was decorated <br>with intricate carvings that had been colored brown with a hot piece of metal. The soldier was still some <br>distance away, but Malao knew exactly what those carvings were.<br><br>Monkeys.<br><br>Malao's upper lip curled back.<br><br>The warrior monks of Cangzhen Temple--or any temple, for that matter--were not allowed to have <br>personal possessions. Personal possessions meant a tie to the greedy world of men, so the monks <br>owned nothing and shared everything. However, within Cangzhen, weapons were an exception. Though <br>they weren't supposed to favor any one more than another, Cangzhen's warrior monks almost always <br>did. Malao's favorite was called a short stick, and the specific stick he preferred was now in that soldier's <br>right hand.<br><br>Malao hugged his knees tight and began to rock back and forth. That soldier had helped slaughter Malao's <br>friends and family and burn down the only home Malao had ever known. And now the soldier planned to <br>walk away with a souvenir. Malao wasn't about to let that happen.<br><br>As the soldier passed under his tree, Malao focused on the rhythm of the soldier's strides. When the <br>soldier's right arm went backward and his weight shifted to his left leg, Malao dropped from the tree like <br>an anvil.<br><br>THUD!<br><br>Malao's feet smashed into the back of the soldier's left knee and the knee buckled, slamming to the <br>ground. Malao grabbed the stick and flipped forward, twisting it out of the soldier's hand and leaping onto <br>a low-lying branch. He grinned at the soldier and waved the stick.<br><br>"Get down here, you little monkey!" the soldier said, staggering to his feet.<br><br>Malao shook his head and scurried to a higher branch.<br><br>"Don't play games with me, monk. I see your orange robe. You better not make me climb up there after <br>you."<br><br>Malao turned to leap to another tree when the soldier raised his voice. "I said get down here!"<br><br>Malao stopped. If the soldier raised his voice any louder, reinforcements might come. Malao had no <br>interest in fighting an entire garrison of soldiers. He needed to do something, fast. He zipped to the <br>opposite side of the tree so that he was directly behind the soldier, facing the same direction as the man, <br>and jumped straight down. He landed with one small foot on each of the soldier's shoulders.<br><br>The surprised soldier tilted his head up and grabbed on to Malao's robe.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Something Chocolate This Way Comes: A Baby Blues Collection (Baby Blues Scrapbook #21)</h2><p>Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott put out a very funny cartoon strip.

More than 400 species occur here annually, and 514 species have been recorded. That is more kinds of birds than any other landbounded area of comparable size in the United States. In fact, only Texas, California, and Florida have state lists that exceed the total list for the 15,000-square-mile area encompassed by Southeastern Arizona. Of these birds, 36 species are not regular anywhere else in the U.S., and another 40-plus are confined to the zone along the U.S. border with Mexico.</p><p>About the Author Hiking up to 500 miles each summer for eight years while conducting research on the Elegant Trogon, Richard Cachor Taylor developed an intimate knowledge of the birds, habitats, and locations throughout Southeastern Arizona. In 1977 he reported the first Eared Trogon seen in the United States. Inevitably, his interest in trogon ecology led him south into Mexico and Central America, where he soon discovered the magic of other tropical birds. In 1980 Rick founded Borderland Tours. Responsible ecotourism, he believes, provides an economic incentive for the preservation of plant and wildlife communities throughout the world. Aside from leading tours to locations from Alaska to South America every year, Rick has authored location checklists for finding birds in Arizona&#x2019;s Chiricahua and Huachuca Mountains. His most recent books include Trogans of the Arizona Borderlands, published in 1994, and the first edition of his A Birder&#x2019;s Guide to Southeastern Arizona, published in 1995.</p><h2>Lighting the Way: Nine Women Who Changed Modern America</h2><p>In this highly readable, illuminating narrative that spans the twentieth century, Karenna Gore Schiff tells the remarkable stories of nine influential women who each in her own way tackled inequity and advocated a change. These women recognized our country wasn't living up to its promise and fought to alter it.<p>The women she's selected are as varied as they are inspirational. Ida B. wells-Barnett, who was born a slave and fought against lynching; Mother Jones, an Irish immigrant who organized coal miners and campaigned against child labor; Alice Hamilton, who pushed for regulation of industrial toxins; Frances Perkins, who established our social secruity program; Virginia Durr, a high society Southern belle who fought the poll tax and segregation; Septima Clark, who helped to register black voters; Dolores Huerta, who organized farm workers; Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias, an activist for reproductive rights; and Gretchen Buchenholz, currently one of the nation's leading child advocates.</p><p>Karenna Gore Schiff delivers an intimate and accessible account of the nine trail-blazing women who deserve not only to be honored but to have their example serve as a guiding light for activists and leaders of tomorrow.</p></p><p>Karenna Gore Schiff is the eldest daughter of Al and Tipper Gore. She is the director of community affairs for the Association to Benefit Children, a children&#39;s advocacy organization. She lives in Manhattan with her husband and two children. This is her first book.Schiff, who is most notably Al Gore's oldest daughter and a lawyer and journalist, has put together a collective biography of nine outstanding American women of the 20th century&#x2014;some unjustly little known. The more celebrated are Ida B. Wells-Barnett (1862&#x2013;1931), an African-American journalist who brought the horrors of lynching to public attention; Mother Jones (c. 1837&#x2013;1930), an Irish immigrant and lifelong crusader for workers' rights; and Frances Perkins (1882&#x2013;1965), the first woman Cabinet member, appointed by FDR. Schiff also illuminates less renowned but highly influential figures, including Alice Hamilton (1869&#x2013;1970) a physician and pioneer in calling attention to the dangers of industrial poisons, and Septima Poinsette Clark (1898&#x2013;1987), child of a former slave, who became a teacher and tireless advocate for racial equality. Several of the subjects are still alive, like Dolores Huerta, cofounder with C�sar Ch�vez of the United Farm Workers, and Gretchen Buchenholz, who established the Association to Benefit Children. Schiff has done excellent research, and though her prose isn't especially stylish, she shows her heroines as fully rounded figures. She points out, for example, that Wells-Barnett's feud with the NAACP was counterproductive and that Mother Jones's opposition to women's suffrage limited her reach. <i>(Feb. 8)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The catalog of an exhibition at New York's Guggenheim Museum in the fall of 1999, it contains a wide range of writings, including Robert Creeley's haunting poetry, a thorough chronology, and half a dozen essays, including the introductory "Once You Begin the Journey You Never Return," by the Guggenheim's Lisa Dennison. In accordance with Clemente's paintings and drawings, the book touches on themes from Indian mysticism, prayer, the body's pores and orifices, family bonds, and a number of metaphysical and physical concerns, being and nothingness among them. In the essay "Rooms," Francesco Pellizzi draws a long thread through cave painting, Meister Eckhart's sermons on the soul, Renaissance Rome, and Clemente's wall paintings to arrive at "the transmodern sense of a shifting place of origin; every step, every station, is the first and last in this vortex, a maelstrom animated by an eros that is enveloping and inevitable but also, in the end, joyous...." <p> Clemente's art, which lays bare his obsessions with sex, self, and spirituality and explores them with a constantly surprising range of intense color and formal invention, stands in bracing, deeply pleasurable opposition to the desiccated, design-bound, theory-driven work that has dominated so much art of the last 25 years. Art historian James Elkins has described making graduate students copy, stroke for stroke, works by Monet and other painters, to give them a feel for "What Painting Is" (as he titled his recent book). Clemente raises the stakes a notch, demonstrating what painting might be, if we were to allow ourselves to be drenched in its myriad possibilities. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>Francesco Clemente (b. 1952) has, since the 1980s, been a leading artist in the international revival of expressionist figure painting and sculpture. Clemente&#39;s subjects-rooted in both the physical and the surreal, spiritual worlds-create a vast body of work that appeals to diverse audiences. This stunning book is published to accompany a major retrospective exhibition. Clemente draws upon a pan-historic web of im pulses, mediating among the myriad cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, Byzantium, Europe, India, and America. Stylistically his work recalls the Italian Renaissance, Indian miniatures, European Romanticism, Abstract Expressionism, and Pop Art. Clemente&#39;s widespread cultural interests and nomadic lifestyle-New York is his home but he spends part of each year in Italy, India, and the New Mexico desert-have deeply affected his art. 350 illustrations in full color, 10 x 1111/2&#34; Lisa Dennison is deputy director and chief curator at the Guggenheim Museum, New York.

The pup, otherwise healthy, has a twisted leg, and the mother knows what the harsh code of the pack demands. Her pup will be taken from her and abandoned on a desolate hill. The pack cannot have weakness - the wolf mother knows that her pup is condemned to die.<br><br>But alone in the wilderness, the pup, Faolan, does not perish. This his story - a story of survival, of courage, and of love triumphant. This is Faolan's story, the wolf pup who rose up to change forevever the Wolves of the Beyond.</p><p>Kathryn Lasky is the Newbery Honor-winning author of over one hundred books for children and young adults. Her beloved Guardians of Ga&#x2019;Hoole fantasy series has sold more than 4 million copies, and she is the author of the Daughters of the Sea series, the Wolves of the Beyond series, as well as A TIME FOR COURAGE and other Dear America titles. Kathryn has also written a number of critically acclaimed nonfiction titles, such as BEYOND THE BURNING TIME and TRUE NORTH. She lives with her husband in Cambridge, MA.<br>Erik Davies seems to be confiding secrets to the listener in his intimate reading of LONE WOLF, the first entry in Lasky&#39;s new series. Her popular GUARDIANS OF GA&#39;HOOLE series, featuring owls, got the big-screen 3-D treatment just this fall. Davies brings a skillful storyteller&#39;s appeal to this tale of a wolf cub raised by a grizzly bear and befriended by (what else?) an owl. But the work itself is an oddly flat introduction, almost like a book-long prologue meant to fill in the story&#39;s mythos and history before actually getting to the fun stuff. It&#39;s hard not to wish, after the pup Faolon&#39;s early escape from death, that this wolf with a twisted paw would stop chasing his philosophical tail and get on with it.

Readers will spot many bold-faced culinary names like Paula Deen and Ina Garten, but also obscure sources like out-of-print cookbooks, local publications, and small-town prizewinners. A handful of no-cake recipes includes cowboy cookies, butterscotch bars, and sinful fried pies. The instructional tone and homespun quality are signature NPR ingredients; fans of the network will find this cookbook a useful and companionable tool for family eating, potlucks, and easy entertaining.</p><h2>Month-By-Month Gardening in Michigan</h2><p>Gardening is now the favorite leisure pastime in America.

An outdoorsman, he lives and works in northern Vermont.An innocent and mild-mannered boy grows up fast and ugly as his choice of friends sucks him into another familys self-destructive tailspin: a relentlessly hardscrabble debut. In the northern reaches of rural Vermont, where dirt roads are fast tracks for renegades and every house and trailer hides a tragedy, 16-year-old Jessup is simply trying to come to terms with a first awkward romance. After going the whole season without kissing the girl who was a summer visitor, hes now left with fishing and daydreaming to occupy his time. All that changes, however, on the day when Reg nearly runs him over as Jessup is trying to hitch a ride after his bike breaks down. Reg is older, a hard-driving, hard-drinking, hard-nosed ex-con with a big marijuana harvest to haul out of the mountains and a grudge against a local pair of brothers who are also in the cultivation business and whom he blames for sending him to prison. He gives Jessup a ride to remember, first introducing him to his family: wheelchair-bound Hal, a weight-guessing barker at county fairs; and Marigold, whose married life hasnt been the same since her logger husband lopped off a piece of his equipment with the chainsaw. Hal and Reg get Jessup so stoned, drunk, and dizzy that hes sick. Then Marigold comes on to him, and when the night is over the boy hardly knows who he is anymore. Worse, the dark side to Reg is swiftly triggered when, in his cabin, he finds a cousin all shot up amid the pot plants. He hatches a malevolent plan, with Jessups unwitting aid, thats somewhere between suicidal and just crazy. When the smoke clears, Jessup is battered, traumatized by all hes seen, and utterly alone. Absent fathers are the supposed reason for this whole misadventure. Maybe, but the characters move at the speed of light toward rack and ruin, and the psychology cant keep up. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His major continuing series features forensic anthropologist-detective Gideon Oliver, &#x201c;the Skeleton Detective.&#x201d; There are fifteen published titles to date in the series. The Gideon Oliver books have been (roughly) translated into a major ABC-TV series and have been selections of the Book-of-the-Month Club, the Literary Guild, and the Readers Digest Condensed Mystery Series.

Mr. Elkins lives on Washington&#x2019;s Olympic Peninsula with Charlotte.<br>Oregon's anthropologist-sleuth Gideon Oliver (A Glancing Light, p. 566, etc.) and his park-ranger wife Julie are attending a conference of anthropologists at Whitebark Lodge, where ten years before Professor Albert Evan Jasper, undisputed top dog in the field, died in a fiery bus crash, at the end of another conference and amid rather mysterious circumstances. Several of the participants in that meeting are once again at Whitebark--one of them is Associate Professor Harlow Pollard, whose bludgeoned body is found in his cottage--the climax of a series of strange events seemingly tied to the past. Gideon cleverly solves the crucial element in that murder--the liveliest part of a sluggish story heavily laden with technical lore, all too rarely lightened with the author's finely honed sense of humor. Fans may be just a tad disappointed--for others, an unrewarding slog. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

After the seemingly obligatory stint living with a sympathetic and worldly aunt in Wisconsin, he escaped to New York City and design school (quite against his parents' wishes), turning in a stellar performance at the institution that would become Parsons School of Design and immediately earning the notoriously hard-won approval of none other than Frank Alvah Parsons. Several hundred society introductions, garden parties, and black-and-white balls later, Truex found himself at the center of the international elite, one of the social register's most sought-after interior designers--not to mention one of the most prized dinner guests in New York and on the Riviera. <p> As an enormously popular instructor at Parsons, and the school's president from 1942 to 1952, Truex influenced American interior design far beyond the rarefied circles of his friends and clients--Brooke Astor, Lady Mendl, Grace Bingham, and the like. And as director of design at Tiffany &amp; Co. from 1955 to 1962, arguably the store's heyday, Truex indeed had a hand in defining upper-class taste--he called it "design judgment"--or at least what went into the place settings on the dining tables of the very wealthy. Many of the designs Truex commissioned and developed for Tiffany's are still sold today as classics of the brand: the all-over wild strawberry china pattern, for example.</p><p> Adam Lewis's illustrated biography is not particularly vivid, and details of Truex's work and design philosophy are scant compared to the exhaustive (and exhausting) descriptions of the charming, urbane decorator's endless social engagements. One must remember, though, that Lewis is writing about the man whose preferred color came to be known as "Truex beige." Perhaps the designer himself would have approved of the stilted style of Lewis's prose, but for those not instantly enchanted by minor high-society and interior-design intrigue, the book's studied humorlessness will make for dull reading. <i>--Liana Fredley</i></p>Adam Lewis is a graduate of the Yale School of Art and Architecture and currently teaches and practices interior design.</p><h2>The Earp Brothers of Tombstone: The Story of Mrs. Virgil Earp</h2><p><p><i>The Earp Brothers of Tombstone</i> and the famous fight at the O. K. Corral are well known to American history and even better known to American legend. This composite biography of Wyatt, Morgan, Virgil, James, and Warner Earp is based on the recollections of Mrs. Virgil Earp, dictated to the author in the 1930s, and amplified by documents he unearthed in 1959. In his review of the book for <i>Library Journal</i>, W. S. Wallace stated that he considered The Earp Brothers of Tombstone "the most authoritative account ever to be published on the subject."</p></p><p><p>Since he began his writing career in 1935, Frank Waters has published many books, among them <i>The Man Who Killed the Deer</i>, <i>The Colorado in the Rivers of America</i> series, <i>Book of the Hopi</i>, and <i>Mexico Mystique</i>.</p><p>"A particularly interesting piece of Americana which will appeal especially to readers of westerns in spite of the fact that it topples several television and folklore idols."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></p> (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br><p>"The dashing legend surrounding the Earp brothers&#x2014;Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan&#x2014;has been debunked before, but not from this special feminine viewpoint. . . .

At least �that&#x2019;s how it looked to Jane Arnold, &#x201c;Sister,&#x201d; as she peered out the window of her hotel room at The Pierre. The taillights of all those cars crawling down Manhattan&#x2019;s Fifth Avenue sparkled in the dark like rubies. When she was young, she would have seen parallel lines of headlights like diamonds coming �toward her as well. Those days were long gone.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember when the streets were two-way?&#x201d; she asked her boyfriend, Gray Lorillard, who was carefully removing items from his Gladstone bag.<br><br>&#x201c;�Uh-�huh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think creating �one-�way streets in 1966 �really made New York traffic move faster?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not.&#x201d; He answered this with conviction, his handsome brow furrowed as he once more reviewed his close items.<br><br>&#x201c;Close&#x201d; meant small clothing: undershirts, underwear, folded good shirts, and his Dopp kit, as well as a beautiful calfskin jewelry case (although men never called it that).<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it helped either,&#x201d; she said, turning from the view, &#x201c;but there were fewer cars then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fewer people,&#x201d; he mumbled, searching for something in his bag. &#x201c;Goddammit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is this male PMS I&#x2019;m observing?&#x201d; she asked, half smirking at him.<br><br>He rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Men don&#x2019;t have mood swings.&#x201d;<br><br>At this, the elegant �seventy-�one-�year-�old woman with the incredible silver hair, let out a whoop.<br><br>Younger by perhaps seven years&#x2014;the year of his birth had a habit of sliding backward&#x2014;Gray, taller than Sister who was six feet, brushed his �steel-�gray military moustache while looking in the mirror above the desk. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t have �them&#x2014;�it&#x2019;s well known that I&#x2019;m �even-�keeled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, you are smoking opium. You&#x2019;re a lot moodier than I am.&#x201d;<br><br>Looking at the beautiful woman who never made the slightest attempt to look younger than she �was&#x2014;�perhaps one of the reasons she was so �striking&#x2014;�Gray shrugged. &#x201c;Janie, we&#x2019;re all moodier than you. I&#x2019;ve never known such a cool customer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if �that&#x2019;s a compliment or an insult.&#x201d; She crossed the plush carpet and put her arm around his waist. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m missing one of my studs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no, the chased gold �fox-�head ones with the ruby eyes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know I put it in here. I did. You know how meticulous I am.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d; She bit her tongue because she wanted to say: And sometimes I wish you were not. &#x201c;Maybe it slid behind the lining. Your bag has some years on it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buy the best. Then you only weep once.&#x201d; He sat on the side of the bed, taking a deep breath. &#x201c;I am not going to panic.&#x201d;<br><br>She sat beside him. &#x201c;Neither am I. Those were your Christmas present three years ago. I bought them from Marion at Horse Country.&#x201d; The proprietor had sneaked Jane the elegant studs when they&#x2019;d �driven up to buy tack for the staff.<br><br>As Master of the Jefferson Hunt, Sister, and her �joint-�master of three years, Dr. Walter Lungrun, were responsible for &#x201c;the furnishings&#x201d;&#x2014;as horse equipment was properly termed&#x2014;as well as for the paid staff, which consisted of one huntsman and one �whipper-�in. Newly added to the payroll, Betty Franklin had served as an honorary, which means amateur, �whipper-�in for decades.<br><br>Betty and her husband faced tightened financial conditions thanks to the sinking economy and the fact that they owned a printing press. Few people patronized true presses anymore so after much discussion, Sister and Walter had worked out the necessary details to give Betty a salary of $25,000. The good woman wept at the offer, tried to refuse, but the two masters insisted. That $25,000 kept the wolf from the Franklins&#x2019; door.<br><br>&#x201c;Sugar, if you truly have lost it, I will buy you another,&#x201d; said Jane.<br><br>&#x201c;I �didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he insisted. &#x201c;It has to be here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go back over the last time you saw it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did that.&#x201d; He rose, kissed her on the cheek, patted his chest pocket. &#x201c;Dammit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your language is going to Hell.&#x201d;<br><br>Her cursing as well made them both laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;My mother would wash my mouth out with soap.&#x201d; He smiled at the memory of the formidable, late LuAnne Lorillard, a power in the African American community long before integration. Nobody messed with LuAnne without ample opportunity to repent later.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, humor me,&#x201d; said Jane.<br><br>&#x201c;All right. I was back home the last time I saw the studs. I went to my dresser after packing my clothing in this bag. I opened the top drawer, lifted out my personal case, carried it to the safe behind the painting that Daddy did, opened it, and took out my studs. I opened the little green leather case, counted them, closed it, and put it in my Gladstone bag.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t men say jewelry case?&#x201d; Jane interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;How many years were you married? As I recall, it was �twenty-�eight. Did you ever ask Raymond?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but I �didn&#x2019;t talk to Raymond as openly as I talk to you,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;�Really?&#x201d; he asked, smiling, liking the compliment.<br><br>&#x201c;�Really. I loved him in my fashion, but it was a different time. Ray had a bombastic streak, which meant he had a difficult time dealing with anything that �didn&#x2019;t emanate from him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I lived in D.C. for most of your marriage, but Ray did not strike me as the sensitive or introspective type. How could you stand it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I had a son, remember?&#x201d; This was said in an upbeat tone. Any memory Sister recalled of her son, who died in a tractor accident in 1974, still brought her happiness.<br><br>She loved Raymond, Jr., beyond reason, but then �doesn&#x2019;t every parent feel that way? Jane long ago came to terms with his death at age fourteen, growing determined to live each day with joy. Her son would have wanted that for her, not a lifetime of grieving and anger.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I forget,&#x201d; Gray quickly replied. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only that I don&#x2019;t associate you with sorrows. You&#x2019;re a force of nature.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know, that may be the most wonderful thing you ever said to me. Now back to your studs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the chain of events until now.&#x201d; His hand went to his left pec again.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I need to buy you a man bra?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m out of cigarettes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t smoke in hotel rooms anymore, at least not in this town. Actually, Gray, you can&#x2019;t smoke in public parks, the list goes on. If the mayor sees you smoking, he will assume you are a lowlife, possibly a cheap criminal. It never occurs to these health nuts the damage they do to others.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean the loss of jobs in our state, North Carolina, and Kentucky? Devastation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That, too, but I was thinking about the people who love laws that inhibit other people&#x2019;s choices. Is smoking a good thing to do? No. But those sanctimonious �rule-�makers live rather luxurious lives. They �aren&#x2019;t working on an assembly line or in scorching sun outside. If your job is repetitive and boring or dangerous, sometimes that little hit of nicotine takes the edge off. The people that make the laws go get prescriptions for Prozac, and how does anyone know the �long-�term effects of all that crap?&#x201d;<br><br>He blinked as he �hadn&#x2019;t heard her that impassioned in months, in fact, not since a person blundered and turned the fox back �toward the hounds at a hunt in November. Fortunately, the fox escaped.<br><br>Sister and Gray, this January 27, had traveled from central Virginia to attend the Masters&#x2019; Ball, an annual extravaganza under the aegis of the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America. For forty years, Sister had attended the annual ball, always at the end of January. She loved to dance, loved to catch up with old friends scattered across the United States and Canada.<br><br>Over the last ten years, oftentimes when she spoke to city dwellers or suburbanites about foxhunting, she would notice the concern or distaste in their faces, so she invariably hastened to add that in the New World, foxes were chased, not killed. Usually, that opened up a torrent of quite intelligent questions and Sister would once again be reminded of how far most people lived from nature.<br><br>The last thing Jane Arnold ever wanted to do was kill a fox. She �wouldn&#x2019;t mind dispatching a few humans, though, one of whom would be at this very ball. She wondered, could you kill a man with a butter knife?<br><br>Gray �couldn&#x2019;t find a cigarette. &#x201c;I am hooked and �that&#x2019;s that.&#x201d; He came and sat down again, forlornly gazing into his opened Gladstone bag as though it would croak an answer concerning his stud. &#x201c;I have stopped many times. Then pressure gets to me and I light up. I hate being controlled by an outside substance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say that I understand. I don&#x2019;t have an addictive personality. I wish you could stop if only to suit yourself. However, smoking �doesn&#x2019;t make you crazy, you don&#x2019;t lose your teeth like those pathetic meth people, and it isn&#x2019;t illegal. And although you say you �aren&#x2019;t moody, honey, there are times when I would happily shove a cigarette in your chiseled lips.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look, you search for your stud. We have three hours until the Ball. I&#x2019;ll pop around the corner to Madison Avenue. As I recall, there&#x2019;s a beautiful little tobacco shop there that sells gorgeous small humidors, cigarette lighters, cases from as early as World War One and, of course, tobacco.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s snowing out there. I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gray, that stud is more important than a little snow on my nose. We hunt in weather worse than this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but you don&#x2019;t hunt in high heels.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start a fad. I&#x2019;ve got my �pull-�on rain boots. My skirt is wool and my sweater is glorious cashmere. You look on your DROID to make sure the store is still operating and I&#x2019;ll ring up the girls. They can come along to keep me company.&#x201d;<br><br>The girls were two young women, freshmen at Princeton, who had hunted with Sister while attending an exclusive girls&#x2019; school, Custis Hall, in central Virginia. They and quite a few other young women hunted with her for the duration of their secondary school education. Some of the faculty hunted, too, always swearing it made environmental studies more exciting for students.<br><br>Within minutes, Sister had rounded up one of the girls, Anne Harris&#x2014;who was called &#x201c;Tootie.&#x201d; Using his phone, Gray verified the store was still in business.<br><br>&#x201c;You can calculate minute by minute the national debt on that thing.&#x201d; Sister admired his toy, as she thought of it.<br><br>&#x201c;If I do that, I won&#x2019;t enjoy the Ball.&#x201d;<br><br>As it turned out, none of them enjoyed the Ball for entirely different reasons than the national debt.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>A gust of wind sent snow swirling around Sister and Tootie as they walked on a side street �toward Madison Avenue.<br><br>&#x201c;I think there have only been about three times in forty years that I&#x2019;ve come to this Ball and the weather �hasn&#x2019;t been filthy. No wonder they stop hunting in New York State early. Genesee Valley stops when the river freezes, which has to be now.&#x201d;<br><br>Sister was telling Tootie about a hunt founded in 1876 by �hard-�riding upstate New Yorkers, among them the Wadsworth family, who still led them.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to go up there and hunt,&#x201d; said Tootie. &#x201c;I can take a train up to Rochester and then rent a car to drive down to the Genesee Valley.&#x201d; Turning her head from the wind, the snow on her creamy caf� au lait skin added to her considerable beauty.<br><br>&#x201c;Next year. I&#x2019;ll come with you. Watching Marion Thorne hunt hounds is always a treat. Then again she has good �whippers-�in. You know, �that&#x2019;s the hardest position to fill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you always told us.&#x201d; Tootie listened closely to everything the older woman had ever told her, as the gorgeous young woman loved hounds, horses, foxes, and Sister, herself.<br><br>Another gust of wet snow smacked them right in the face.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, who needs skin abrasion up here?&#x201d; said Sister. &#x201c;Just go outside. You&#x2019;ll get a few layers peeled right off.&#x201d;<br><br>Tootie wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;Sounds awful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; Sister stepped faster as the shop came into sight.<br><br>&#x201c;Ladies.&#x201d; The owner rose from behind the store&#x2019;s counter when the two swept into the shop. &#x201c;Welcome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re glad to be here.&#x201d; Sister laughed, brushing off her �snow-�covered coat.<br><br>Adolfo Galdos, balding, pudgy, and sixtyish, smiled broadly. &#x201c;One must submit to the weather. �That&#x2019;s what my dear papa always said. He never could fathom how people endured this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cuban?&#x201d; Sister inquired.<br><br>&#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never met a proprietor of a tobacco shop from Barcelona.&#x201d; She smiled, but she had recognized the lilt in his voice.<br><br>&#x201c;There you have it.&#x201d; He beamed anew. &#x201c;For us, tobacco is gold, is art. Someday, and I hope I live to see it, we will return and once again, the finest cigar tobacco in the world will be available to you.&#x201d;<br><br>Tootie quietly studied the shop. Cigarette cases with sapphire clasps, lighters of perfect weight and simple design, sparkled alongside impossibly long cigarette holders.<br><br>Adolfo noticed the object of Tootie&#x2019;s scrutiny. &#x201c;A Dunhill. 1938. That lighter will work as good as the day it was made.&#x201d;<br><br>Now also studying the display case herself, Sister murmured, &#x201c;Beautiful. Oh, look at that.&#x201d;<br><br>He reached into the case, retrieving a heavy silver cigarette case with handwritten names incised. &#x201c;This was given to a British officer by his surviving men.&#x201d; He flipped it open where it was gold inside, the officer&#x2019;s name&#x2014;Cpt. Mitchell Markham&#x2014;was inscribed therein.<br><br>Sister&#x2019;s hand flew to her heart. &#x201c;What a tribute. My father fought in World War One. He never spoke of it, but I expect it affected him all his life and may be one of the reasons he married so late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do we not ask impossible things of people?&#x201d; Adolfo&#x2019;s beautiful green eyes met hers. &#x201c;We left Cuba in 1959. My own father, who owned a tobacco plantation, saw there was no hope and left. Those who grew sugar also fled. Others, thinking the revolutionaries would not come for them, lost everything. Everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is called progress.&#x201d; Sister grimaced. &#x201c;No one learns. It �didn&#x2019;t work for the French in 1791 and it will never work, period.&#x201d;<br><br>Adolfo spoke to Tootie, delighted by her youth and femininity. &#x201c;I hope, Se�orita, that you will never encounter such foolishness.&#x201d;<br><br>Shyly, Tootie responded, &#x201c;I hope so, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ladies, allow me to show you the humidor. The aroma alone is intoxicating.&#x201d; He stepped out from behind the counter, twirled one hand like a drum major, walked to the rear of the store and opened a glass door&#x2014;the fragrance of various cigars, cigarettes, �long-�cut pipe tobacco, filled the room. &#x201c;After you.&#x201d;<br><br>The two entered the �well-�organized room. It was larger than it appeared from outside, looking at the glass door.</p><h2>A Random Walk Down Wall Street: Including a Life-Cycle Guide to Personal Investing</h2><p>This is an investement guide for the 1990s. An entirely new chapter has been added, &#34;A life cycle guide to personal investing&#34;, which shows how individuals can tailor their financial objectives to their particular incomes at any age and how a mix of saving and investment plans will provide funds when needed and for the years beyond retirement. Another new chapter takes up the techniques that turn the odds of success significantly in favour of the individual investor, while debunking premature claims of the death of the random walk theory. In addition, Burton Malkiel explains the new financial instruments that increase the options for either short-or long-run gains.</p><p>It's unlikely that you'll spot many dog-eared copies of <i>A Random Walk</i> floating amongst the Wall Street set (although bookshelves at home may prove otherwise). After all, a "random walk"--in market terms--suggests that a "blindfolded monkey" would have as much luck selecting a portfolio as a pro. But Burton Malkiel's classic investment book is anything but random. Since stock prices cannot be predicted in the short term, argues Malkiel, individual investors are better off buying and holding onto index funds than meddling with securities or actively managing mutual funds. Not only will a broad range of index funds outperform a professionally managed portfolio in the long run, but investors can avoid expense charges and trading costs, which decrease returns.<p> First published in 1973, this seventh printing of a <i>A Random Walk</i> looks forward and does so broadly, examining a new range of investment choices facing the turn-of-the-century investor: money-market accounts, tax-exempt funds, Roth IRAs, and equity REITs, as well as the potential benefits and pitfalls of the emerging global economy. In his updated "life-cycle guide to investing," Malkiel offers age-related investment strategies that consider one's <i>capacity</i> for risk. (A 30-year-old who can depend on wages to offset investment losses has a different risk capacity from a 60-year-old.) In his assessment of rocketing Internet stocks, Malkiel defends his "random" position well, explaining how "the market eventually corrects any irrationality--albeit in its own slow, inexorable fashion. Anomalies can crop up, markets can get irrationally optimistic, and often they attract unwary investors. But eventually, true value is recognized by the market, and this is the main lesson investors must heed." Written for the financial layperson but bolstered by 30 years of research, <i>A Random Walk</i> will help individual investors take charge of their financial future.

Now that geometry is seen from a startling new angle&#x2014;through the clinical eye of a British diplomat, for whom love is only another form of statecraft. Like its predecessors, <i>Mountolive</i> is a novel of vertiginous disclosures, in which the betrayer and the betrayed share secret alliances and an adulterous marriage turns out to be a vehicle for the explosive passions of the modern Middle East.<br><br> &#x201c;Durrell is almost without peer in conveying atmosphere and mood. Even if his Alexandria never existed on this earth, it is now as real as Hawthorne&#x2019;s Rome, Proust&#x2019;s Paris, Loti&#x2019;s Constantinople. . . . <i>Mountolive</i> is dazzlingly cohesive, beautifully controlled from beginning to end.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Saturday Review<br></i><br> &#x201c;A work of splendid craft and troubling veracity.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times<br></i><br> &#x201c;<i>Mountolive</i> has vivid imagery and scenes of ghastly hilarity. . . . Readers will be sharply aware that they are encountering an acute intelligence pursuing a grand design.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>TIME</i></p><p><b>Lawrence Durrell </b>was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St. Edmund's School, Canterbury. His first literary work, <i>The Black Book</i>, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, <i>A Private Country</i>, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: <i>Prospero's Cell</i>; <i>Reflections on a Marine Venus</i>, about Rhodes; and <i>Bitter Lemons</i>, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell's wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, <i>The Alexandria Quartet</i>, which he completed in southern France, where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the quartet and <i>The Avignon Quintet</i> he wrote the two-decker <i>Tunc </i>and <i>Nunquam</i>. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. <i>Caesar's Vast Ghost</i>, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, was published a few days before his death in Sommi�res in 1990.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with JUSTINE, BALTHAZAR, and CLEA.]--The four linked novels that comprise English author Lawrence Durrell's masterpiece, THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, are set in Alexandria, Egypt, around the time of WWII. The four novels explore the city's polyglot society, full of intrigue, mystery, and sensuality, telling essentially the same story from different points of view. JUSTINE focuses on the beautiful Jewish wife of a wealthy Copt. Her story is told by Darley, her English lover. In BALTHAZAR, Darley reconsiders and retells the story he told in Justine, using information from a mysterious new character, Balthazar. In MOUNTOLIVE, as war begins to loom, British Ambassador David Mountolive enters the intrigues of the interwoven community of characters. In CLEA, Darley returns to a war-fevered Alexandria as the stories of the many characters move toward conclusion. Narrator Nigel Anthony provides a brilliant reading, keeping the variety of voices--English, French, Egyptian--distinct throughout. He offers a one-man play, conveying the passions, disappointments, and triumphs of the complex cast. The classical music interludes that delineate sections of this beautifully produced and packaged set help transport the listener to back- streets of Alexandria. R.E.K.

He has received the Nation/Discovery Award as well as fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Institutes. Mr. Galvin divides his time between Iowa City, where he teaches at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, and his ranch near Tie Siding, Wyoming.</p>A passionate hundred-year history of a small mountain ranch on the Colorado-Wyoming border. Galvin (Writing/Univ. of Iowa) was raised and still lives for part of each year in Tie Siding, Wyoming. Here, he tells of the lives of his neighbors and of the successive owners of a ranch consisting in the main of a 360-acre hay meadow. Galvin's annals are comprised of one hundred very brief vignettes, remarkable for their sympathetic portrayals of these men and women and their Antaeus-like symbiosis with the beautiful but unforgiving land. Cutting back and forth in time, the author tells of Appleton (``App'') Worster, who homesteaded the meadow in 1895, raising three boys but losing two wives and finally the farm itself in 1938. App was buried on a ridge where his sons had to use drills and dynamite to dig his grave. Galvin also writes of App's son Ray, who, while logging at age 12 with his brothers and father, saw a man fishing and was struck dumb by astonishment--it was the first time Ray had ever seen someone he didn't know. And then there's the meadow's present owner, Lyle, slowly drowning in emphysema and condemned to sitting by himself and gazing at the log buildings he made by hand and at the meadow where he cut timothy grass for 40 years. Galvin's montage engages through its multiple views, but just as often it perplexes: The funeral of a man is described, but then the man reappears and dies only later in the book; and the relationships between some of the principal characters prove a formidable puzzle, at least at first. Still, Galvin's progressive deepening and widening of his story, and his comely prose, more than compensate. Close-ups of seldom-seen bedrock people of the American West, adroitly drawn and deeply felt. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The volume introduces the ambivalence of the age and would make a welcome gift not only for teenagers, but for their parents, as well."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br></p><p>Grade 9 Up?Kherdian hung out with Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and other icons of the Beat domain; he heard their disdain and absorbed their inspired agony. Here, he has gathered a representative sampling of their work, both East and West Coast poets, both well-known and incidental. Ginsberg's epic "Howl" appropriately opens the volume. Kaufman's "Bagel Shop Jazz" offers one of the best looks at the movement with its "turtle-neck angel guys" and "mulberry-eyed girls in black stockings...lost in a dream world where time is told with a beat." The lines are harsh, speaking of abuse, drugs, sex, and carnage amid hope and dreams. The words are oft confusing, sometimes seemingly random, but always flailing against that brick wall of convention. With an open mind and ear, readers can gather a pretty good sense of the thoughts and lives of these confused, mighty, and eloquent writers. Brief bios offer a fleeting additional glimpse. For a condensed and intense view of one aspect of this troubled generation, Beat Voices can't be beat. The poetry is palpable and powerful. While perhaps not for everyone's tastes, these lines of poetry and sometimes prose offer a vision of the movement that challenged authority, religion, common sense, and life in general. Today's YAs should be able to relate to their intent, if not their specific words and references.?Sharon Korbeck, Waupaca Area Public Library, WI<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Back in 1960, before he began writing for children, Newbery Honor author Kherdian (The Road from Home) carved out a berth for himself among the Beat poets of San Francisco; as he writes in his introduction to this highly personal anthology, he was among the first to publish articles about their work, and he knew the central figures intimately. Here he highlights the rebellious and bohemian spirit of the times with poems by Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Diane di Prima and many others. With an essay by Holt editor Marc Aronson, brief biographical sketches of the poets and an excellent bibliography, this book offers a lively and historically useful entree to the Beat movement. In Kherdian's view, the '50s and early '60s comprise "the last period" in which poetry "that is alive, that breathes, that touches our soul" was written. While his selection does not always reflect the best work of individual poets, the volume itself plunges the reader into the teeming life of the "angelheaded hipsters" (Ginsberg) who watch "the world walk by in its curious shoes" (Lawrence Ferlinghetti).

This delightful book combines accounts of the lives of these intriguing characters with descriptions of the plants that bear their names and the stories of their chance discoveries or deliberate breeding.LEGENDS IN THE GARDEN<br><br>One spring morning a lady walking through a garden in the Midwest was fascinated with a row of handsome, vigorous hollies. They were just what she needed for her own garden and she asked her host what they were. "Those are 'Nellie Stevens' hollies" was the reply. She looked again and couldn't help but wonder about the name. Who in the world was Nellie Stevens, ad how did her name ever become associated with this plant?<br><br>She noted other intriguing names and asked similar questions. She noted a beautiful blue clemantis and wondered if Betty Corning was still alive and what stories she had to tell. She wondered about the places and people whose names were associated with so many popular garden plants. She is not alone.<br><br>If necessity is the mother of invention, curiosity is the mother of research. In many cases, we wonder not what our gardens grow, but who our gardens grow. If not for an absent-minded Englishman, we might not be admiring Frances Williams' hosta, and if two ladies from Anna, Illinois had not gone riding that day, perhaps one of our most treasured hydrangeas would not enhance our gardens.<br><br>Until now, these accounts have not been compiled and unfortunately, many of the people are disappearing, their stories with them.

Not softened, but more inspired by love, celebration, memories and even nostalgia. She aims her intimate and sparing words at family and friends, the deaths of heroes and friends, favorite meals and candy, nature, libraries, and theatre. But in between, the deep and edgy conscience that has defined her for decades shines through when she writes about Rosa Parks, hurricane Katrina, and Emmett Till's disappearance, leaving no doubt that Nikki has not traded one approach for another, but simply made room for both.</p></p><p><p>Nikki Giovanni, poet, activist, mother, and professor, is a seven-time NAACP Image Award winner and the first recipient of the Rosa Parks Woman of Courage Award, and holds the Langston Hughes Medal for Outstanding Poetry, among many other honors. The author of twenty-eight books and a Grammy nominee for <em>The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection</em>, she is the University Distinguished Professor of English at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia.</p>The extraordinarily popular Giovanni got that way as a black militant during the 1970s, known for her inspirational, fiery live and recorded performances. This first volume since her 2003 <i>Collected Poems</i> loses the fire but keeps the inspiration: "Poetry says No to destruction and Yes to possibility," Giovanni declares. Her mix of lineated and prose poetry says yes over and over&#x2014;to the glories of children and grandmothers, to "the men with hopes and dreams and talents," as well as to the memory of the African-American cultural heroes who died in the last few years. Many pages are, in effect, orations: "We will miss June Jordan. For her courage, her insight, her love of us all. We will miss this poet." Some of the strongest and most detailed works are short, not especially lyrical, pieces in prose. One remembers meeting Gwendolyn Brooks; another shows a grandmother's strong support for Virginia Tech Hokies football. Giovanni's most serious verse and prose link her own struggles&#x2014;as a black woman, as a latter-day icon, as a cancer survivor, as a teacher&#x2014;to the larger patterns of black American history, of striving toward freedom always: "I choose always as best I can to keep truth and compassion in my life." <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He plays peekaboo with a hermit crab and fences with a swordfish until he eventually discovers a pirate's treasure chest, but he leaves most of it behind when he meets what's on the next page-a shark. Still, he manages to bring a coin back up to his mother, who is waiting for him at the surface. The last page shows all of the animals left behind looking a little less intimidating as they float in the bathtub. Although the concept is fun and the bubbly illustrations are colorful, the book falters due to the text's occasionally bumpy rhythm. "Way down deep in the deep blue sea,/I spy a sea horse racing by me./Hello, sea horse./Giddy-up, sea horse./See you later, sea horse./Swim away."

Arguably the best [biography of Stonewall]." &#x2015;<em>Washington Post Book World</em></strong></p> The charismatic Confederate general Stonewall Jackson, who began his military career in the Mexican War, earned his great fame in the Civil War in a series of brilliantly fought battles. He was given the name Stonewall at the First Battle of Bull Run, when his brigade faced overwhelming odds but held the line.

Indeed, it appears to be a timeless and inescapable biological condition. And yet perceptions of hunger and of the hungry have changed over time and differed from place to place. Hunger has a history, which can now be told. </p><p> </p><p> At the beginning of the nineteenth century, hunger was viewed as an unavoidable natural phenomenon or as the fault of its lazy and morally flawed victims. By the middle of the twentieth century, a new understanding of hunger had taken root. Across the British Empire and beyond, humanitarian groups, political activists, social reformers, and nutritional scientists established that the hungry were innocent victims of political and economic forces outside their control. Hunger was now seen as a global social problem requiring government intervention in the form of welfare to aid the hungry at home and abroad. James Vernon captures this momentous shift as it occurred in imperial Britain over the past two centuries. </p><p> </p><p> Rigorously researched, <i>Hunger: A Modern History</i> draws together social, cultural, and political history in a novel way, to show us how we came to have a moral, political, and social responsibility toward the hungry. Vernon forcefully reminds us how many perished from hunger in the empire and reveals how their history was intricately connected with the precarious achievements of the welfare state in Britain, as well as with the development of international institutions, such as the United Nations, committed to the conquest of world hunger. All those moved by the plight of the hungry will want to read this compelling book. </p></p><p>James Vernon is Professor of History, University of California, Berkeley.A work of exciting originality that uses hunger to challenge our essential ideas about the history of the welfare state and of democracy and citizenship in twentieth-century Britain. This is a very major book. (Geoff Eley, University of Michigan)<br><br>A lively and engaging study that demonstrates how hunger is as much a historical condition as it is a biological one. Elegant, intelligent, and ambitious, it will be widely read and admired. (Philippa Levine, University of Southern California)<br><br><i>Hunger: A Modern History</i> moves impressively between the British domestic and political, the colonial and the global, without straining the argument or losing touch with the sources. James Vernon's research ranges over vast tracts of material, demonstrating concretely and graphically how discussion about famine originating in nineteenth-century India became central to discussion about nutrition in twentieth-century Britain. (Gareth Stedman Jones, Cambridge University)<br><br>This is history writing of the most jolting and publicly significant kind. (Bruce Robbins, Columbia University)<br><br>We think of hunger and famine as symptoms of a failed economy and government. But shifting cultural perceptions of hunger are historical agents in their own right, as this probing study, concentrating on 19th- and 20th-century Britain, shows...Vernon offers much lucid, trenchant rethinking on a resonant subject. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2007-09-10)<br><br>Vernon has put together a persuasive and wide-ranging history of hunger. His central tenet that hunger is not a natural catastrophe--it emerges into public view within historical contexts and for precise political reasons--is compelling. (Joanna Bourke <i>The Times</i> 2007-11-24)<br><br>This survey of British attitudes towards hunger is no mere liberal guilt-inducer...The book ends in the 1940s with glances forward to Thatcher, Tebbit, and Blair. Its range is political, sociological, and media-aware: "Tell the bastards!" says a 1930s documentary film-maker. Scholarly and unjudgmental, the book does. (Martin Hoyle <i>Financial Times</i> 2007-12-15)<br><br><i>Hunger</i> is a thought-provoking book. Sharply focused and tightly argued. (Michael Sargent <i>Nature</i>)<br><br>Charts, in great detail, the way hunger was constructed in the 19th century as something that the lazy and spineless brought upon themselves and how this perception changed in the 20th century with the emergence of the welfare state. <i>Hunger</i> may well be the subject of the book but in many ways it is the site for a discussion of the claims of market-based liberalism and social democracy and the way both camps depicted the very welfare state that, among other things, sought to eliminate malnutrition. (Steven Carroll <i>The Age</i> 2007-12-29)<br><br>This tension--between the global and the local, the high-calorie west and the hungry rest--lies at the heart of <i>Hunger: A Modern History</i>. Historian James Vernon's widely acknowledged grasp of political history from the ground up brings depth and discernment to this compellingly argued and cogently written book. Vernon aims to provide a history of hunger in the UK and the British Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, beginning with the pomp and circumstance of the 1851 Great Exhibition aand ending with the cheerful austerity of the 1951 Festival of Britain. He uses changing British responses to hunger as a window on the rise of new forms of civil society and social welfare, and as a way to explore another recurring theme in his work--the question of responsibility. Who was to blame for hunger, and who could be expected to relieve it?...This eye for both sides of a debate makes <i>Hunger: A Modern History</i> both acutely moving and, in the main, profoundly persuasive...<i>Hunger: A Modern History</i> is politically engaged history at its most humane, and Vernon uses his compassion and erudition to drive home a deeply disquieting truth. In the secular, postmodern west, hunger is perhaps the closest we get to guilt.

Ari Goldman's best-selling book, <em>The Search for God at Harvard</em>, chronicled his search for signs of genuine religious faith at Harvard Divinity School. He concluded that God was not very evident at the prestigious Ivy League campus. In <em>Finding God at Harvard</em>, Kelly Monroe Kullberg reveals a different picture of Christian faith in a secular intellectual setting. She presents the compelling testimonies of forty-two faculty members, former students, and distinguished orators at Harvard. Their candid reflections explode the myth that Christian faith cannot survive a rigorous intellectual atmosphere. <em>Finding God at Harvard</em> speaks to the emptiness that haunts college campuses across the country--an emptiness that only Truth can fill. As Monroe's contributors so vividly show, that Truth is available to everyone.

The Free Speech Movement, antiwar rallies, and trips to Vietnam and Cuba are re-created alongside Ken Kesey's Acid Tests, San Francisco be-ins, LSD trips, large and small, and rock festivals across the country. And gradually we see that while the zenith of the Grateful Dead experience was the moment of abandon to music, drugs, and dance, it was as a safe haven from the turmoil beyond the gates that the music and the culture won their place in the hearts of fans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No stranger paradox emerges in these pages than the role the CIA played as Johnny Appleseed to an infant drug culture. With its LSD-testing programs in college towns, such as the one where Ken Kesey and Robert Hunter, later Garcia's lyricist, first tasted the forbidden fruit, the CIA sowed the seeds of the chemical manipulations of consciousness that remain a leitmotiv of the Dead's culture of enchantment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, a new portrait of the nonleader leader emerges, as those closest to Jerry Garcia, particularly his second wife, Mountain Girl, speak of his passions and his demons. We see Garcia as a musical existentialist enamored of tradition, a man possessed of a strange, all-encompassing influence who held to a vision of the Grateful Dead's destiny even as he recoiled from the juggernaut it became.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>An absorbing and exhilarating exploration of a major chapter in America's cultural history, <b>Sweet Chaos</b> gives us, at last, an understanding of why the Dead means so much to so many.</p><p>What a long, strange trip it's been, indeed. Carol Brightman's examination of the Grateful Dead's history supports the widely held belief that it was more than just a psychedelic band. The Grateful Dead was a cultural phenomenon from its beginnings in the late 1960's up until its untimely demise following the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995.<p> Brightman does more than just present a chronology of the band's history. She explains how the Grateful Dead both influenced and was influenced by the turbulence of the events unfolding around them in the 1960's. Rather than just telling the same old story of how the band evolved from a house band for Ken Kesey's infamous Acid Tests to the top-grossing act of the early 1990's, she presents detailed histories of the band members, their families, their friends, and everyone else they came into contact with. It is also a fascinating look at the emergence of the 1960's drug culture and the involvement of everybody from Timothy Leary to the CIA.</p><p> Whether you're a baby boomer Deadhead who has followed the band since its beginnings or a Generation X Deadhead who jumped on the bandwagon when the band hit the Top 40 in the late 1980's, this book is a must-read. <i>Sweet Chaos</i> is a compelling report of a period in United States history and of a band that is truly beyond description. <i>--Michael Mariani</i></p>"Formlessness and chaos lead to new forms. And new order. Closer to, probably, what the real order is."<br>--Jerry Garcia<br><br>"I enjoyed this book immensely. Brightman's perspective is valid and necessary, coming as it does from outside the enchanted realm but with access to intimate details of life at the harrowing center. Speaking as a peer, in an authoritative voice bent on illumination rather than scandal or hagiography, she explores how and why 'the fierce attachments of radicals seemed to have melted into air [while] this fringe group [turned] into something like a national monument.' In so doing, she places the Grateful Dead in the context of the political zeitgeist. Anybody who ever wondered about the Dead and the Deadheads should read Sweet Chaos to understand why the significance of this culture cannot--and should not--be underestimated."<br>--David Gans, host of The Grateful Dead Hour and author of Conversations with the Dead</p><h2>Recover to Live: Kick Any Habit, Manage Any Addiction: Your Self-Treatment Guide to Alcohol, Drugs, Eating Disorders, Gambling, Hoarding, Smoking, Sex and Porn</h2><p><b>From Symptoms of Withdrawal and <i>Moments of Clarity</i> Christopher Kennedy Lawford comes a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling book that will save lives.</b><br><br>For most of his early life, Christopher Kennedy Lawford battled life-threatening drug and alcohol addictions.

You're probably too deep into therapy to appreciate how deep into futility veteran <i>New York Times</i> writer and longtime Jets chronicler Eskenazi can descend in this irreverent history.<p> The Jets saga is certainly a surreal one. "The Jets I came to write about," Eskenazi observes, "were like life as Kafka or George Carlin might have pictured it--only more so. They led an existence based in the everyday reality so many of us faced, one of small victories offset by large losses." Dubbing them the most famous bad franchise in sports, he makes a fumblerooski of a case. Other than the 1969 Super Bowl miracle engineered by Joe Namath, the Jets have been constantly sacked for losses. They are the only professional sports team without a single coach who can boast a career-winning record as a Jet. They played in the first game ever suspended due to lightening. The longest play in their history--a 90-yard run from scrimmage--failed to produce a touchdown. Their starting quarterback broke his toe--watching TV. Their star linebacker fell for Sly Stallone's wife. And they're the only pro football team to play its home games in a stadium bearing the name of the other team in town.</p><p> Of course, the Jets' losing ways could end with the hand-off of the helm to Bill Parcells, a coach Eskenazi intriguingly characterizes as more obsessed with not failing than just winning. Then again, management--just in time for the 1998 season--did decide to bring the old uniforms back. Yes, the Jets won Super Bowl III in them. But they found ways to lose big in them, too. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Gerald Eskenazi has been writing about sports for <i>The New York Times</i> for the last three decades, and about the New York Jets since 1975.

is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened in human history. Believe it or not&#x2014;and I know that most people do not&#x2014;violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species&#x2019; existence. The decline, to be sure, has not been smooth; it has not brought violence down to zero; and it is not guaranteed to continue. But it is an unmistakable development, visible on scales from millennia to years, from the waging of wars to the spanking of children.</p><p>No aspect of life is untouched by the retreat from violence. Daily existence is very different if you always have to worry about being abducted, raped, or killed, and it&#x2019;s hard to develop sophisticated arts, learning, or commerce if the institutions that support them are looted and burned as quickly as they are built.</p><p>The historical trajectory of violence affects not only how life is lived but how it is understood. What could be more fundamental to our sense of meaning and purpose than a conception of whether the strivings of the human race over long stretches of time have left us better or worse off? How, in particular, are we to make sense of <i>modernity</i>&#x2014;of the erosion of family, tribe, tradition, and religion by the forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason, and science? So much depends on how we understand the legacy of this transition: whether we see our world as a nightmare of crime, terrorism, genocide, and war, or as a period that, by the standards of history, is blessed by unprecedented levels of peaceful coexistence.</p><p>The question of whether the arithmetic sign of trends in violence is positive or negative also bears on our conception of human nature. Though theories of human nature rooted in biology are often associated with fatalism about violence, and the theory that the mind is a blank slate is associated with progress, in my view it is the other way around. How are we to understand the natural state of life when our species first emerged and the processes of history began? The belief that violence has increased suggests that the world we made has contaminated us, perhaps irretrievably. The belief that it has xxi decreased suggests that we started off nasty and that the artifices of civilization have moved us in a noble direction, one in which we can hope to continue.</p><p>This is a big book, but it has to be. First I have to convince you that violence really has gone down over the course of history, knowing that the very idea invites skepticism, incredulity, and sometimes anger. Our cognitive faculties predispose us to believe that we live in violent times, especially when they are stoked by media that follow the watchword &#x201c;If it bleeds, it leads.&#x201d; The human mind tends to estimate the probability of an event from the ease with which it can recall examples, and scenes of carnage are more likely to be beamed into our homes and burned into our memories than footage of people dying of old age.1 No matter how small the percentage of violent deaths may be, in absolute numbers there will always be enough of them to fill the evening news, so people&#x2019;s impressions of violence will be dis...</p></p><h2>Narrow Margin: The Battle of Britain and the Rise of Air Power 1930-1949 (Pen &amp; Sword Military Classics)</h2><p>The Battle of Britain saved not only that country from invasion, but also altered the course of the war for the rest of the world.<br><br>This remarkable book traces the fortunes of the Royal Air Force and provides a comprehensive account of the Battle of Britain, including day-by-day summaries of the battle.

The gravity of the situation is matched by a general paucity of understanding about what is happening and how it started.&nbsp;<br><br>In this book, based on his 2012 Adorno Lectures given in Frankfurt, Wolfgang Streeck places the crisis in the context of the long neoliberal transformation of postwar capitalism that began in the 1970s. He analyses the subsequent tensions and conflicts involving states, governments, voters and capitalist interests, as expressed in inflation, public debt, and rising private indebtedness. Streeck traces the transformation of the tax state into a debt state, and from there into the consolidation state of today. At the centre of the analysis is the changing relationship between capitalism and democracy, in Europe and elsewhere, and the advancing immunization of the former against the latter.</p><p><b>Wolfgang Streeck</b> is the director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Research in Cologne and Professor of Sociology at the University of Cologne. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics and a member of the Berlin Brandenburg Academy of Sciences as well as the Academia Europaea.&#x201c;A superbly provocative work of political economy.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Aditya Chakrabortty, <i>Guardian</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;For anyone interested in understanding the bind democracies are in, this is a vital if sobering book which has a troubling, if convincing, conclusion.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Matthew Lawrence, <i>Prospect</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Is electoral democracy compatible with the type of economic policies the EU&#x2014;backed at a distance by Washington and Wall Street&#x2014;wants to impose? This is the question posed by the Cologne-based sociologist Wolfgang Streeck in <i>Buying Time</i>, a book that is provoking debate in Germany. Streeck argues that since Western economic growth rates began falling in the 1970s, it has been increasingly hard for politicians to square the requirements of profitability and electoral success; attempts to do so (&#x2018;buying time&#x2019;) have resulted in public spending deficits and private debt. The crisis has brought the conflict of interests between the financial markets and the popular will to a head: investors drive up bond yields at the &#x2018;risk&#x2019; of an election. The outcome in Europe will be either one or the other, capitalist or democratic, Streeck argues; given the balance of forces, the former appears most likely to prevail. Citizens will have nothing at their disposal but words&#x2014;and cobblestones.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Susan Watkins, <i>London Review of Books</i><br></b><br> &#x201c;Streeck has here provided an excellent and challenging account of the current state of relations between capitalism and democracy. His concept of a state whose democratic responsibilities to voters are required systematically to be shared with and often trumped by those to creditors takes us a major step forward.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Colin Crouch, author of <i>Coping With Post-Democracy</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Argues that ever since the 1970s, governments in the west have been &#x2018;buying time&#x2019; for the existing social and political order ... a timely corrective.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014; Larry Elliott, <i>Guardian</i><br></b><br> &#x201c;In its best parts&#x2014;when political passion connects with critical exposition of the facts and incisive argument&#x2014;Streeck&#x2019;s sweeping and empirically founded inquiry reminds one of Karl Marx&#x2019;s <i>Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i>.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014; J�rgen Habermas<br></b><br> &#x201c;Logically organized, well argued, scholarly informed, and rich in theoretical references and statistical series covering nearly six decades.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014; Robert Boyer, <i>ILR Review</i><br></b><br>&#x201c;[<i>Buying Time</i>] reinvigorates the tradition to reflect on the inherent friction between democracy and capitalism in broad historical analyses ...

Throughout his professional career Merckx amassed an astonishing 445 victories. Lance Armstrong, by comparison, has managed fewer than 100.<br>&nbsp;<br>For Britain's leading cycling writer, William Fotheringham, the burning question remains, why? What made Eddy Merckx so invincible?<br>&nbsp;<br>Merckx was a machine. It wasn't just the number of victories; it was his remorseless domination that created the legend. Once, already comfortably leading the 1969 Tour de France, Merckx hammered a further eight and a half minutes out of his nearest rivals during an 85-mile solo break in the Pyrenees. But his triumphs only tell half a story that includes drug-busts, horrific injury and death. He was nicknamed 'The Cannibal' for his insatiable appetite for victory, but the moniker did scant justice to this handsome, sensitive, and surprisingly anxious man.<br>&nbsp;<br>In Half Man, Half Bike, Fotheringham goes back to speak to those who were there at the time. The result is the extraordinary and definitive story of a man whose fear of failure would drive him to reach the highest pinnacles before ultimately destroying him.</p><p>WILLIAM FOTHERINGHAM writes for the <i>Guardian </i>and <i>Observer </i>on cycling and rugby. A racing cyclist and launch editor of procycling and <i>Cycle Sport </i>magazines, he has reported on over twenty Tours de France. He is the critically lauded author of <b>Fallen Angel</b><i>, </i><b>Roule Britannia</b>, and <b>Put Me Back on My Bike</b><i>, </i>which <i>V�lo </i>magazine called 'The best cycling biography ever written.Within the world of professional cycling, no name conjures such complete dedication and domination of the sport than that of Eddy &#x201c;the Cannibal&#x201d; Merckx, dubbed for his voracious appetite for winning. Fotheringham expertly traces Merckx&#x2019;s career from his early races in Belgium to his successes at the Tour de France, painting a nuanced portrait of a man best described by his wife as &#x201c;driven on by a power that was unique to him.&#x201d; The power behind this account is Fotheringham&#x2019;s skill in bringing Merckx&#x2019;s races alive on the page. Woven throughout is a thoughtful discussion of the impact of Belgium&#x2019;s ethnic divide between Flemish and French and its affect on Merckx&#x2019;s career, as well as insightful analysis of how Merckx&#x2019;s quiet and introverted personality helped to build his mystique. While Fotheringham clearly holds Merckx in high regard, he avoids the sycophantic tone of many sports biographies by placing Merckx within the wider cycling world at the time. This approach gives a rich depth to the book while still paying tribute to a remarkable athelete. --Eve Gaus</p><h2>The Rock Says...</h2><p><p>The Rock says. . . "Know your damn role--and shut your mouth!" But that simple catch-phrase, embraced by the millions �and the millions--of The Rock's fans, can't begin to capture the spirit and larger-than-life personality of the most electrifying man in sports-entertainment."</p><p>In this action-packed, revealing and outrageously funny memoir, World Wrestling Federation Superstar The Rock recounts his life in and out of the ring with unapologetic honesty and inimitable style. From his boyhood days traveling around the world with his father (professional wrestler Rocky Johnson) to his years as a football player at the University of Miami to his meteoric rise through the ranks of the Federation, The Rock Says. . .chronicles in vivid detail the life story of one of sports-entertainment's most innovative and best-loved personalities.</p><p>The Rock recalls his injury-plagued career at Miami and a subsequent foray to the Great White North, where he discovered that in Canada being a professional football player is not exactly a glamorous life. After a few months of sleeping on putrid, stained mattresses that he dug out of the garbage and subsisting on nothing but plain spaghetti, "D.J." ditched his cleats forever and set his sights on the path of his father and grandfather--wrestling.</p><p>Performing first in the minors as plain old Dwayne Johnson, then as "Flex Kavana" and later as "Rocky Maivia," he quickly became one of the World Wrestling Federation's hopefuls. But no matter how he tried to get over with the fans, the stadiums greeted him with chants of "Rocky sucks! Rocky sucks!" He then adopted the brash persona of The Rock--a snorting, spitting, snotting, swearing son-of-a-bitch with the soul of a smart-ass comic and the body of an Adonis--and he found his true calling as the "People's Champion."</p><p>The Rock will take fans on a guided tour of big-time professional wrestling, a highly competitive business in which a handful of gifted and lucky performers dominate, and all others dream of a moment in the spotlight. He provides a breathtaking, minute-by-minute account of Wrestle Mania, the Super Bowl of pro wrestling, including an intimate backstage look at rehearsals with his opponent, Stone Cold Steve Austin. And he discusses in heartfelt detail the loss of his friend and co-worker, Owen Hart.</p><p>Filled with genuinely touching stories of love and strife, hilarious anecdotes, inside accounts of an industry whose machinations have long been shrouded in secrecy and dozens of previously unpublished photographs from The Rock's personal collection, <em>The Rock Says. . .</em>is--as The Rock himself might put it--"the coolest thing since the other side of the pillow if you smell what The Rock is cookin'."</p></p><p>Hot on the bleeding heels of Mankind's <i>Have a Nice Day!</i> comes another memoir by a bad-guy character World Wrestling Federation fans love to hate, edited by the same prose coach, the clever Jeremie Ruby-Strauss (and coauthored by Joe Layden). Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. the Rock--who calls himself "the People's Champion," affects an arched eyebrow to convey entertaining menace, and coins catch phrases like a standup comic--gives you plenty of colorful, jumbled action photos and the growling accounts of staged mayhem that made Mankind's book a bestseller. But his story is more interesting than that of Mankind, his occasional ring rival. The noisy action chapters alternate with passages of more reflective conventional autobiography: the Rock is a third-generation pro wrestler, and his book amounts to a history of the sport. His grandpa, High Chief Peter Maivia, was a Samoan important enough to be buried in Diamond Head's crater, and his dad, Rocky Johnson, was George Foreman's sparring partner and the first African American World Wrestling Federation Intercontinental champ. The Rock is candid about the battles his family faced outside the ring: the marriage-testing road lifestyle, his dad's most important win (over the bottle), and the author's own dangerous temper. There's something touching about the Rock's unpromising debut in his uncle Tonga's old trunks, in his reverence for his elders--and something scary about his reaction when he thinks people lack such respect.<p> What, you say? You'd rather hear about the Rock's "schmozz" (free-for-all) with Mankind, or Faarooq and the interracial Nation of Domination, or that Budweiser-popping piece of trailer trash Stone Cold Steve Austin, or the Undertaker, whose skin is "the color of bad meat"? You want to hear how he started out sleeping on a pungent mattress retrieved from a garbage dump and wound up wearing Versace shirts and chatting up Gennifer Flowers on TV at WrestleMania XIV? You crave the secrets of the Frankenstein, the Gorilla Position, Jake the Snake, and Mankind's Mandible Claw (a dirty sock he shoves down opponents' throats)? That's all here, too. Just hop in the ring--the Rock will show you around. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><p>In addition to his home in Miami, where he lives with his wife, Dany, The Rock has a permanent suite at Smack Down Hotel, on the corner of Know Your Role Boulevard and Jabroni Drive. He is the youngest champion in World Wrestling Federation history.</p></p><h2>Ordinary Lives in the Early Caribbean: Religion, Colonial Competition, and the Politics of Profit (Early American Places Ser.)</h2><p><p>Kristen Block examines the entangled histories of Spain and England in the Caribbean during the long seventeenth century, focusing on colonialism&#x2019;s two main goals: the search for profit and the call to Christian dominance.</p><p>Using the stories of ordinary people, Block illustrates how engaging with the powerful rhetoric and rituals of Christianity was central to survival. Isobel Criolla was a runaway slave in Cartagena who successfully lobbied the Spanish governor not to return her to an abusive mistress. Nicolas Burundel was a French Calvinist who served as henchman to the Spanish governor of Jamaica before his arrest by the Inquisition for heresy. Henry Whistler was an English sailor sent to the Caribbean under Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s plan for holy war against Catholic Spain. Yaff and Nell were slaves who served a Quaker plantation owner, Lewis Morris, in Barbados. Seen from their on-the-ground perspective, the development of modern capitalism, race, and Christianity emerges as a story of negotiation, contingency, humanity, and the quest for community.</p><p><i>Ordinary Lives in the Early Caribbean</i> works in both a comparative and an integrative Atlantic world frame, drawing on archival sources from Spain, England, Barbados, Colombia, and the United States. It pushes the boundaries of how historians read silences in the archive, asking difficult questions about how self-censorship, anxiety, and shame have shaped the historical record. The book also encourages readers to expand their concept of religious history beyond a focus on theology, ideals, and pious exemplars to examine the communal efforts of pirates, smugglers, slaves, and adventurers who together shaped the Caribbean&#x2019;s emerging moral economy.</p></p><p>KRISTEN BLOCK is an assistant professor of history at Florida Atlantic University.<p>Based on both a wide-ranging scholarly literature and a broad and deep archival base, <i>Ordinary Lives in the Early Caribbean</i> raises important questions about the relationship between Christianity and profit seeking in the early modern Atlantic. Block&#x2019;s use of personal stories to advance her arguments allows her to address big questions with a clarity and specificity that should appeal to undergraduates and specialists alike.</p> (April Lee Hatfield <i>author of<i> Atlantic Virginia: Intercolonial Relations in the Seventeenth Century</i></i>)<br><br><p>Kristen Block's case studies of ordinary men and women in the Caribbean, and her creative use of the fragmentary sources they left, illuminate the ways in which they negotiated the spaces within and between empires, and their use of religious identification in those negotiations. By taking religion seriously and looking across colonial empires, she has produced a study that will be must reading for everyone interested in the early modern Atlantic.</p> (Karen Ordahl Kupperman <i>Silver Professor of History, New York University</i>)<br><br><p>Block enhances our appreciation of how religion was manifest in the lives of ordinary Caribbean sojourners by drawing upon an expanded archival base and by imaginatively re-creating the world of her subjects.</p> (Carla Gardina Pestana <i><i>William &amp; Mary Quarterly</i></i>)<br><br><p>Block&#x2019;s study is based on a very impressive archival base, and she narrates the stories with skill.</p> (M. Mulcahy <i><i>Choice</i></i>)<br><br><p>Overall, Block&#x2019;s work provides a unique window into the conflict between increased commerce and religion in the seventeenth century. The dual focus on Spanish and British colonies creates an excellent comparison of how Protestantism and Catholicism dealt with similar issues of race, slavery, and social control.</p> (Robert C.

Alexei Jawlensky (1864&#x2013;1941) was Russian, but lived in Germany much of his life and obtained German citizenship in 1934. He was a friend of Vasily Kandinsky, who he met in Munich when studying painting with Anton Azb�, and had close ties to the German Expressionist artists. This book illustrates how the artist was influenced, apart from the German Expressionists, by the art of Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Paul C�zanne, Henri Matisse and the Fauves, and by Ferdinand Hodler. The book presents the chronological and thematic development of Jawlensky&#x2019;s art from early figure painting to landscapes and from still lives to the late iconic portraits and fascinating meditations.</p><p>Vivian Endicott Barnett is the author of several volumes of the Kandinsky<br><br>catalogue raisonn� and has published widely on Expressionist art."<i>Alexei Jawlensky</i> presents the chronological and thematic development of Jawlensky's art from early figure painting to landscapes and from still lives to the late iconic portraits and fascinating meditations.

This novel involves a good theoretical puzzle that will keep readers turning pages but still emerges as mostly a homage to the departed sf master. Allen has emerged during the last 10 years as a versatile and imaginative writer in his own right, and it's hard not to prefer seeing him sail under his own colors, however much he (and we) may justly admire the late Asimov. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Kristy&#39;s Mystery Admirer (Baby-Sitters Club, No. 38)</h2><p>Kristy needs the help of the Baby-sitters Club to find out who is sending her mysterious notes, which are mushy at first but then start getting weird and creepy.</p><p></p><h2>Star Wars: Dark Empire Trilogy HC</h2><p>Six years after the fall of the Empire in Return of the Jedi, the battle for the galaxy&#39;s freedom rages on.

Hanafuda is the only one of the several games perennially enjoyed in this country: Mah Jong, Go, and Shogi all came from China. Consequently, the hanafuda cards bear pictures of seasonal flora and fauna treated in distinctively Japanese ornamental styles. For instance, the &#34;pine&#34; will probably remind the Westerner of cactus, and the shawl-shaped things over the head of the man with an umbrella are unlikely to suggest rain; but that is what they are. This may sound confusing, but in fact, once a few conventions are mastered - and that takes no time with the clear explanations in this book - the reader can expect hours of enjoyment from an arresting and amusing card game. Although there are numerous variants of hanafuda, this book concentrates on the most popular: a simple game called Matching Flowers and the more sophisticated and vastly more entertaining Eighty-eight and Koi-Koi. The text carefully explains the meanings of the pictures on the cards and their values as well as how to take tricks, count points, and keep score. Sample game situations are included to enable the reader to master the rules and start having fun as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><h2>The Brothers Reuther and the Story of the UAW: A Memoir</h2><p>UAW Reuther leadership</p><p></p><h2>Ysabel</h2><p>While his famed photographer father works to record Saint-Saveur Cathedral of Aix-en-Provence, Ned Marriner wanders the halls and rooms of the ancient structure, uncovering some of the many secrets of the monument and discovering that it is not as empty as it appears.By the author of The Last Light of the Sun. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Guy Gavriel Kay is the international bestselling and award-winning author of several acclaimed fantasy novels.

Fifteen-year-old Canadian Ned Marriner accompanies his famous photographer father, Edward, on a shoot at Aix-en-Provence's Saint-Saveur Cathedral while his physician mother, Meghan, braves the civil war zone in Sudan with Doctors Without Borders. As Ned explores the old cathedral, he meets Kate Wenger, a geeky but attractive American girl who's a walking encyclopedia of history. In the ancient baptistry, the pair are surprised by a mysterious, scarred man wielding a knife who warns that they've "blundered into a corner of a very old story. It is no place for children." But Ned and Kate can't avoid becoming dangerously entangled in a 2,500-year-old love triangle among mythic figures. Kay also weaves in a secondary mystery about Ned's family and his mother's motivation behind her risky, noble work. The author's historical detail, evocative writing and fascinating characters&#x2014;both ancient and modern&#x2014;will enthrall mainstream as well as fantasy readers.<i> (Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After all, she could use the money--not to mention the great exposure. Her catering business is in shambles, and publicizing her new venture as a personal chef will help get her back on track. Plus taping the shows at Colorado's posh Killdeer Ski Resort will be fun. A little cooking, a little chitchat. What could go wrong?<br><br>The question Goldy should have asked is, what wouldn't go wrong--especially when she has to drive through a blizzard to do one of her shows live for a PBS telethon.<br><br>To make matters worse, Goldy has an unpleasant duty to perform right after the show. She and her policeman husband, Tom, have agreed to sell a piece of Tom's treasured war memorabilia to help ease their financial woes. The buyer: Doug Portman, art critic, law enforcement wannabe--and, to her eternal embarrassment, Goldy's ex-boyfriend.<br><br>Predictably, the live broadcast is riddled with culinary catastrophes--from the Chesapeake Crabcakes right down to the Ice-Capped Ginger Snaps. But the deadliest dish of all comes after the cameras go off, when an unexplainable skiing accident claims Doug Portman's life--and Goldy is the one who finds his crumpled body on the slopes. Even more shocking is what police find tucked away in Doug's BMW: a greeting card with a potentially deadly chemical inside.<br><br>As the police try to determine if Doug's accident was really foul play, Goldy does a little investigating of her own--but finds more questions than answers. Was Doug, chairman of the state Parole Board, accepting bribes from potential parolees? Was he connected to the ex-con who's been telling Killdeer skiers that he's planning to poison a cop? And how did Goldy and Tom get mixed up in this mess?<br><br>When a series of suspicious mishaps places Goldy's own life in jeopardy, she knows she must whip up her own crime-solving recipe, and fast--before a hearty dose of intrigue and a deadly dash of danger ends her cooking career once and for all....<br>Winter sports can be dangerous, but can they also be deadly? "Cooking at the Top!," Goldy's new TV show, is broadcast from one of Colorado's poshest ski areas. Unfortunately, she finds whipping up delicacies at 11,000 feet as perilous as skiing steep runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a telethon raising money for the widow of a tracker killed mysteriously ends in disaster.

In <i>Tough Cookie</i>, Davidson's ninth culinary mystery, Goldy is waiting to reopen her catering business, which has been shut down by the health department for lack of adequate drains. She's got a PBS cooking gig for a few weeks, and is trying to build a reputation as a personal chef, but she's desperate for a little extra Christmas cash, so she agrees to sell a pair of vintage skis to Doug Portman, a local art critic and former sort-of-romantic interest. <p> When Portman's killed in a skiing accident at Killdeer Resort with Goldy nearby, the police treat her with suspicion. It turns out that Portman was the easily persuaded head of the Parole Board, and Goldy's ex-husband (a.k.a. The Jerk, who was imprisoned for domestic violence) is coming up for parole. But when Goldy herself narrowly escapes a chilly death after her van is forced off a snowy highway, she starts looking for connections and steps into a minefield of unsolved murders, including the three-year-old avalanche death of her friend Nate Bullock. There're a multitude of suspicious characters lurking around Killdeer: Barton Reed, a crazy ex-con who sent Portman a letter loaded with poison; Arthur Wakefield, whose wealthy mother was also killed in a skiing accident at Killdeer; Jack Gilkey, a handsome young chef who was convicted of manslaughter in the death of Wakefield's mother (and released by Portman); Boots Faraday, a local artist; and even Rorry Bullock, Nate's angry widow. As usual, Goldy manages to solve the murders (with the help of Chocolate Coma Cookies), save her own skin (just!), skewer a few local snobs in passing, and revive her catering business. Lots of fun, and recipes too. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Five-star praise for the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling mysteries of Diane Mott Davidson, "the Julia Child of mystery writers" (<i>Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph</i>):<br><br>"Today's foremost practitioner of the culinary whodunit."<br>--<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><br>"A cross between Mary Higgins Clark and Betty Crocker!"<br>--<i>The Sun,</i> Baltimore<br><br>"You don't have to be a cook or a mystery fan to love Diane Mott Davidson's books.

Now in this new collection of stories--several of which have never before appeared in print and more than half that have never been collected--that will dazzle the senses and haunt the imagination. Miraculous inventions and unforgettable characters inhabit these pages: an elderly widow who finds the Holy Grail in a second-hand store...a frightened little boy who bargains for his life with a troll living under a bridge by teh railroad tracks...a stray cat who battles nightly against a recurring evil that threatens his unsusupecting adoptive family. In these stories, Gaiman displays the power, wit, insight and outrageous originality that has made him one of the most unique literary artists of our day.</p><p>This anthology of short stories, and the occasional story poem, is vintage Neil Gaiman: quirky, sometimes very funny, often dark and disturbing. Most have been published before, but are hard to find elsewhere and cover all of Gaiman's writing life. As Gaiman says in his introduction, "most of the stories in this book are about love in some form or another," but not requited love. The stories in <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i> touch on all of Gaiman's themes: sex, death, dreams, and the end of the world. From "Chivalry," about the Holy Grail and where it finally ended up, to "Troll Bridge," a very adult version of "The Three Billy Goats Gruff"; from "Bay Wolf," a story poem that melds <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Baywatch</i>, with interesting results, to "Murder Mysteries," which is about a murder, but also about angels, God's will, and Evil, these stories leave lasting impressions. Fans of Ray Bradbury's short stories and of Gaiman's other works will enjoy this collection. <i>--Nona Vero</i><p>In the deft hands of <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong>, magic is no mere illusion... and anything is possible. In this, Gaiman's first book of short stories, his imagination and supreme artistry transform a mundane world into a place of terrible wonders -- a place where an old woman can purchase the Holy Grail at a thrift store, where assassins advertise their services in the Yellow Pages under "Pest Control," and where a frightened young boy must barter for his life with a mean-spirited troll living beneath a bridge by the railroad tracks.

The irrational, all-pervading violence of the modern world is the subject of this extraordinary tour de force. The central character&#39;s dreams are haunted by images of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, dead astronauts and car-crash victims as he traverses the screaming wastes of nervous breakdown. Seeking his sanity, he casts himself in a number of roles: H-bomber pilot, presidential assassin, crash victim, pscyhopath. Finally, through the black, perverse magic of violence he transcends his psychic turmoils to find the key to a bizarre new sexuality.</p><p>Easily one of the 20th century's most visionary writers, J. G. Ballard still lives far ahead of his time. Called his "prophetic masterpiece" by many, <i>The Atrocity Exhibition</i> practically lies outside of any literary tradition. Part science fiction, part eerie historical fiction, part pornography, its characters adhere to no rules of linearity or stability. This reissued edition features an introduction by William S. Burroughs, extensive text commentary by Ballard, and four additional stories. Of specific interest are the illustrations by underground cartoonist and professional medical illustrator Phoebe Gloeckner. Her ultrarealistic images of eroticism and destruction add an important dimension to Ballard's text.When the Atrocity Exhibition was originally printed (1970), Nelson Doubleday saw a copy and was so horrified he ordered the entire press run shredded. Two years later Grove Press brought out a small hardback printing re-titled &#34;Love and Napalm: Export USA.&#34; Now Re/Search brings out an illustrated, large-format edition of this notorious work, augmented with four recently written stories, plus extensive annotations--written by the author, never before published--which clarify and illuminate this exhilarating, prophetic masterpiece.</p><h2>Martha&#39;s Vineyard: An Affectionate Memoir</h2><p><b>The legendary island of Martha's Vineyard is revealed as never before through inspiring paintings by Ray Ellis and a captivating history by Ralph Graves.</b> <br> <br>Martha's Vineyard is a celebrated vacation haven equally captivating summer residents and daytrippers.

Struggling to fit into village life, Saaski&#39;s final comprehension of who she is and what she must do make a mooving story with contemporary parallels.</p><p>Grade 4-6?This well-written novel incorporates elements of folklore into an examination of society's response to those who are perceived as different. The plot centers on the experiences of Saaski, a changeling who was cast out by the "Folk" because of her human father. While she does not initially recall her past life, persecution by the villagers eventually rekindles her memories and fires her resolve to rescue the human child for whom she was exchanged. Aided in her quest by Tam, an orphan who accepts her oddness and cherishes her friendship, Saaski is ultimately successful and thus repays the kindness of her "foster" family by returning their daughter to them. Some readers may find Saaski's cruel treatment by the villagers upsetting and her future with Tam unsettlingly vague, but both are consistent with McGraw's clear intention of using her novel to expose peoples' prejudices and emphasize the importance of being true to oneself. While this unusual blend of fantasy and contemporary concerns may not find a wide audience, the quality of McGraw's writing ensures that for those, like Tam, who can appreciate the unusual, The Moorchild will truly be a magical find.?Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Moql's father is human and her mother one of the Moorfolk, who live beneath the moor. Moql belongs to neither world, but her human blood, which prevents her from changing shape or disappearing at will, makes her dangerous to the Folk. An exchange is made; they have a human child to train as a slave and Moql becomes Saaski, a village child unaware of her origins. As a changeling in the human world, Saaski is regarded as a freak. The concepts of hate and love initially elude her--the Folk are essentially amoral--but she learns about one at the hands of vigilantes and about the other when she makes peace with herself and returns her new mother's love with the perfect gift. A complex and finely drawn character, Saaski undergoes a gradual awakening to her true nature that readers will find intriguing and poignant. McGraw (Tangled Webb, 1993, etc.) makes of Saaski's struggles an emotionally satisfying story; the moor, where Saaski's two lives intersect, is an especially evocative setting.

Two of the disc jockeys at one of the local radio stations would spend Monday morning picking through the photographs and nominating the Bow-Wow Bride, the woman they deemed the ugliest of all the ladies who&#x2019;d taken their vows in the Philadelphia region over the weekend. The grand prize was a case of Alpo.<br> <br>I heard the disc jockeys doing this on my way to school one morning&#x2014;&#x201c;Uh-oh, bottom of page J-6, and yes . . . yes, I think we have a contender!&#x201d; Jockey One said, and his companion snickered and replied, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not a veil big enough to hide that mess.&#x201d; &#x201c;Wide bride! Wide bride!&#x201d; Jockey One chanted before my mother changed the station back to NPR with an angry flick of her wrist. After that, I became more than a little obsessed with the contest. I would pore over the black-and-white head shots each Sunday morning as if I&#x2019;d be quizzed on them later. Was the one in the middle ugly? Worse than the one in the upper-right-hand corner? Were the blondes always prettier than the brunettes? Did being fat automatically mean you were ugly? I&#x2019;d rate the pictures and fume about how unfair it was, how just being born with a certain face or body could turn you into a punch line. Then I&#x2019;d worry for the winner. Was the dog food actually delivered to the couple&#x2019;s door? Would they return from the honeymoon and find it there, or would a well-meaning parent or friend try to hide it? How would the bride feel when she saw that she&#x2019;d won? How would her husband feel, knowing that he&#x2019;d chosen the ugliest girl in Philadelphia on any given weekend, to love and to cherish, until death did them part?<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure of much back then, but I knew that when&#x2014;if&#x2014;I got married, there was no way I&#x2019;d put a picture in the paper. I was pretty certain, at thirteen, that I had more in common with the bow-wows than the beautiful brides, and I was positive that the worst thing that could happen to any woman would be winning that contest.<br> <br>Now, of course, I know better. The worst thing would not be a couple of superannuated pranksters on a ratings-challenged radio station oinking at your picture and depositing dog food at your door. The worst thing would be if they did it to your daughter.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m exaggerating, of course. And I&#x2019;m not really worried. I looked across the room at the dance floor, just beginning to get crowded as the b&#x2019;nai mitzvah guests dropped off their coats, feeling my heart lift at the sight of my daughter, my beautiful girl, dancing the hora in a circle of her friends. Joy will turn thirteen in May and is, in my own modest and completely unbiased opinion, the loveliest girl ever born. She inherited the best things I had to offer&#x2014;my olive skin, which stays tan from early spring straight through December, and my green eyes. Then she got my ex-boyfriend&#x2019;s good looks: his straight nose and full lips, his dirty-blond hair, which, on Joy, came out as ringlets the deep gold of clover honey. My chest plus Bruce&#x2019;s skinny hips and lean legs combined to create the kind of body I always figured was available only thanks to divine or surgical intervention.<br> <br>I walked to one of the three bars set along the edges of the room and ordered a vodka and cranberry juice from the bartender, a handsome young man looking miserable in a ruffled pale blue polyester tuxedo shirt and bell-bottoms. At least he didn&#x2019;t look as tormented as the waitress beside him, in a mermaid costume, with seashells and fake kelp in her hair. Todd had wanted a retro seventies theme for the party celebrating his entry into Jewish adulthood. His twin sister, Tamsin, an aspiring marine biologist, hadn&#x2019;t wanted a theme at all and had grudgingly muttered the word &#x201c;ocean&#x201d; the eleventh time her mother had asked her. In between pre-party visits to Dr. Hammermesh to have her breasts enlarged, her thighs reduced, and the millimeters of excess flesh beneath her eyes eliminated, Shari Marmer, the twins&#x2019; mom, had come up with a compromise. On this icy night in January, Shari and her husband, Scott, were hosting three hundred of their nearest and dearest at the National Constitution Center to celebrate at Studio 54 Under the Sea.<br> <br>I passed beneath a doorway draped with fake seaweed and strands of dark blue beads and wandered toward the table at the room&#x2019;s entrance. My place card had my name stenciled in elaborate script on the back of a scallop shell. Said shell contained a T&amp;T medallion, for Tamsin and Todd. I squinted at the shell and learned that my husband, Peter, and I would be sitting at Donna Summer. Joy hadn&#x2019;t picked up her shell yet. I peered at the whirling mass of coltish girls until I saw Joy in her knee-length dark blue dress, performing some kind of complicated line dance, hands clapping, hips rocking. As I watched, a boy detached himself from a cluster of his friends, crossed the room with his hands shoved in his pockets, and said something to my daughter. Joy nodded and let him take her hand as he led her underneath the strobe that cast cool bubbles of bluish light.<br> <br>My Joy, I thought as the boy shifted his weight from foot to foot, looking like he was in desperate need of the bathroom. It isn&#x2019;t politically correct to say so, but in the real world, good looks function as a get-out-of-everything-free card. Beauty clears your path, it smooths the way, it holds the doors open, it makes people forgive you when your homework&#x2019;s late or you bring the car home with the gas gauge on E. Joy&#x2019;s adolescence would be so much easier than mine. Except . . . except. On her last report card, she&#x2019;d gotten one A, two B&#x2019;s, and two C&#x2019;s instead of her usual A&#x2019;s and B&#x2019;s (and worlds away from the straight A&#x2019;s I&#x2019;d gotten when I was her age and had more brains than friends). &#x201c;She just doesn&#x2019;t seem as engaged, as present,&#x201d; her teacher had said when Peter and I had gone in for our parent-teacher conference. &#x201c;Is there anything unusual going on at home?&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter and I had shaken our heads, unable to think of a thing&#x2014;no divorce, certainly, no moves, no deaths, no disruptions. When the teacher had folded her eyeglasses on her desk and asked about boyfriends, I&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s twelve.&#x201d; The teacher&#x2019;s smile had been more than a little pitying. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be surprised,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Except I wouldn&#x2019;t. Other mothers, maybe, but not me. I kept a close watch on my daughter (too close, she&#x2019;d probably say). I knew her teachers, the names of her friends, the horrible, whiny boy singer she likes, the brand of twenty-bucks-a-bottle shampoo on which she blows the bulk of her allowance. I know the way she struggles with reading and is a whiz at math, and that her favorite thing in the world to do is swim in the ocean. I know that apricots are her favorite fruit, that Tamsin and Todd are her best friends, that she worships my little sister and is terrified of needles and bees. I&#x2019;d know if anything had changed, and Joy&#x2019;s life, I explained, was the same as it had ever been. Her teacher had smiled and patted my knee. &#x201c;We see it a lot with girls her age,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, putting her glasses back on and glancing at the clock. &#x201c;Their worlds just get bigger. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll be fine. She&#x2019;s got involved parents and a good head on her shoulders. We&#x2019;ll just keep an eye on things.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if I don&#x2019;t do that already, I&#x2019;d thought. But I&#x2019;d smiled and thanked Mrs. McMillan and promised to call with any concerns. Of course, thirty minutes later, when I&#x2019;d gone straight to the source and asked Joy whether anything was wrong, my interrogation had been met with the shrug/eye-roll combination that is the hallmark of adolescent girls everywhere. When I&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not an answer,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d replied, &#x201c;Seventh grade&#x2019;s harder than sixth,&#x201d; and opened her math book to let me know definitively that the conversation was over.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d wanted to call her pediatrician, a psychologist, her old speech therapist, at the very least the school&#x2019;s principal and guidance counselor. I&#x2019;d made a list of possibilities: tutoring centers and homework-help websites, support groups for parents of premature children or kids with hearing loss. Peter had talked me out of it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one quarter of seventh grade,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d argued. &#x201c;All she needs is time.&#x201d;<br> <br>Time, I thought now. I sipped my drink and shoved the worries away. I&#x2019;ve gotten good at that. At the age of forty-two, I&#x2019;ve decided, ruefully, that I&#x2019;m slightly inclined toward melancholy. I don&#x2019;t trust happiness. I turn it over as if it were a glass at a flea market or a rug at a souk, looking for chipped rims or loose threads.<br> <br>But not Joy, I thought as I watched my daughter shuffle back and forth with the boy&#x2019;s hands on her hips, laughing at something he&#x2019;d said. Joy is fine. Joy is lovely and lucky. And in the manner of almost-thirteen-year-olds everywhere, my daughter has no idea how lovely, or how lucky, she is.<br> <br>� &nbsp; � &nbsp; �<br> <br>&#x201c;Cannie!&#x201d; Shari Marmer&#x2019;s voice cut across the crowded atrium of the Constitution Center, where guests were clustered, waiting to take their seats for dinner. I clutched my shell and my drink and gave a halfhearted wave as she hustled over, all bright red lips and blepharoplasty, a new diamond solitaire trapped in the Grand Canyon of her cleavage. &#x201c;Yoo-hoo! Can-nie!&#x201d; Shari singsonged. I groaned inwardly as she grabbed my arm with her French manicure. When I tried to pull away, her hand came with me and ended up lodged beneath my right breast. My embarrassment was instant and excruciating. Shari didn&#x2019;t appear to notice.<br> <br>&#x201c;You and Peter are sitting with us,&#x201d; she said. She swept me into the dining room, where I saw thirty tables for ten draped in aquamarine tablecloths with seashell centerpieces, topped with glittering disco balls.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great!&#x201d; I said. Why? I wondered. Shari and Scott had relatives, grandparents, actual friends who should have been sitting with them. And it wasn&#x2019;t as if Shari and I needed to catch up. Our kids were best friends, and even though we&#x2019;d never become friends ourselves, we had years of shared history and saw each other plenty. Just last month we&#x2019;d spent an entire day together, rehashing our latest reality-TV fixation and grating thirty pounds of potatoes for our synagogue&#x2019;s annual preschool Latkefest. Peter and I could&#x2019;ve been over at Gloria Gaynor with the Callahans, or at Barry Gibb with Marisol Chang, whom I&#x2019;d loved since I&#x2019;d met her ten years ago in Music Together class.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; Shari asked me, waving her toned, sculpted, and possibly lipo&#x2019;d arm at the room as we made our way toward the head table.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fantastic,&#x201d; I said loyally. &#x201c;And Tamsin and Todd did a wonderful job.&#x201d;<br> <br>She tightened her grip on my arm. &#x201c;Do you really think so?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They were great. You look amazing.&#x201d; That, at least, was the undisputable truth. Eight years older than me, Shari had been in advertising in New York before marriage and motherhood. Her job now was self-maintenance, and she worked at it harder than I&#x2019;d worked at any paid employment I&#x2019;d ever had. Frying potato pancakes in the synagogue&#x2019;s kitchen, I&#x2019;d listened, awestruck and exhausted, as Shari had described her rounds: the personal trainer, the yoga and pilates, the facials, the waxing, the laser treatments and the eyelash tinting, the low-cal, low-carb meals delivered each morning to her door. It was, perhaps, the one good thing about never having been beautiful&#x2014;you didn&#x2019;t have to kill yourself trying to hold on to something you&#x2019;d never had in the first place.<br> <br>&#x201c;And the party?&#x201d; Shari fretted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not too much?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all!&#x201d; I lied.<br> <br>Shari sighed as a gold-medallioned, Jheri-curled DJ who was a dead ringer for a pre-incarceration Rick James led her parents to the front of the room for the blessing over the bread. &#x201c;Tamsin&#x2019;s furious. She says that marine biology is a serious science, and that I&#x2019;m . . .&#x201d; Her bejeweled fingers hooked into air quotes. &#x201c;&#x2018;Trivializing her ambitions&#x2019; with seashell centerpieces and mermaid costumes.&#x201d; She blinked at me with her newly widened eyes. &#x201c;I think the waitresses look cute!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Adorable,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;They should,&#x201d; Shari muttered. &#x201c;I had to pay them extra to wear bikinis. Something about the health code.&#x201d; She towed me through the crowd, past the tables draped in ocean-blue tablecloths, and over to Donna Summer. Of the ten people at the table, six were family, two were me and Peter, and numbers nine and ten were the programming director of the city&#x2019;s public radio station and his wife. I waved at my husband, who was standing in the corner, deep in conversation with a gastroenterologist of our acquaintance. Better Peter than me, I thought, and sank into my seat.<br> <br>The elderly woman to my left peered at my place card, then at my face. My heart sank. I knew what was coming. &#x201c;Candace Shapiro? Not Candace Shapiro the writer?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Former,&#x201d; I said, trying to smile as I spread my napkin over my lap. Suddenly the gastroenterologist wasn&#x2019;t looking so bad. Ah well. I supposed I should be flattered that Shari still thought my name was worth dropping. I&#x2019;d written one novel under my own name almost ten years ago and, since then, had produced a steady stream of science fiction under a pseudonym. The pay for sci fi was a lot worse, but anonymity turned out to suit me much better than my fifteen minutes of fame had.<br> <br>My seatmate placed one spotted, shaking hand on my forearm. &#x201c;You know, dear, I&#x2019;ve had a book inside me for the longest time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My husband&#x2019;s a doctor,&#x201d; I told her gravely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he could help you get it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>A puzzled look crossed the aged party&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your idea?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s about a woman who gets divorced after many years of marriage . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled, sipped my drink, and tried to turn her synopsis into a pleasant blur of sound. A minute later, Peter appeared at my side. I shot him a grateful smile as he took my hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; he said to the woman. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re playing our song. Cannie?&#x201d;<br> <br>I got to my feet and followed him to the dance floor, where a few grown-up couples had worked their way in among the kids. I waved at Joy, stretched up to plant a quick kiss on the dimple in Peter&#x2019;s chin, and leaned in to his tuxedoed chest. It took me a minute to recognize the music. &#x201c;&#x2018;Do It Till You&#x2019;re Raw&#x2019; is our song?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had to get you out of there, so it is now,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And here I was, hoping for something romantic.&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;You know. &#x2018;I Had His Baby, But You Have My Heart.&#x2019;&#x201d; I rested my cheek on his shoulder, then waved at Shari and Scott Marmer as they fox-trotted past us. Scott looked euphoric, puffed up and proud of his children. His round brown eyes and his bald spot gleamed under the disco lights, along with his cummerbund, made of the same red satin as Shari&#x2019;s gown. &#x201c;Can you believe that&#x2019;s going to be us this fall? I looked at Shari more closely. &#x201c;Except I probably won&#x2019;t be getting my implants refreshed beforehand.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No need,&#x201d; Peter said, and dipped me. When the song was over, I raised my hands to my hair, which felt fine, then dropped them to my hips, encased in black velvet. I thought I looked all right. No less an authority than my daughter had signed off on my ensemble. True, she&#x2019;d done so with a less than enthusiastic I guess it&#x2019;s okay, and told me on our way into the building that if I took my shoes off at any point in the evening and wandered around like a homeless person, she would legally emancipate herself, which children were allowed to do these days.<br> <br>I wondered, the way I always did on occasions like this, what people thought when they saw me and Peter together, and whether it was some incredulous version of He&#x2019;s married to her?

There are even several short science-related plays. Many of the experiments are old standards, but there are some new gems such as trying to bat half a ball or imitating animal stances as if they were yoga positions. All of the demonstrations use common materials and include appropriate safety warnings. Activities are organized in a unique manner--by the amount of time and effort involved (quick, make time, and sequential experiments), and then further subdivided by subject area. A thorough listing of books, magazines, and videotapes is also included. As a result, this title is an excellent reference source for teachers and parents. Moreover, Bosak has done a wonderful job of connecting science to other topics, such as including a relevant Sioux fable in the environment section or viewing rubbings of tree barks and leaves as art. The only problem is with the design of the book, which is a mishmash of text-laden pages, black-ink illustrations (often featuring cutesy animals), and pages splattered with different styles of boxes and type fonts. The result is hard on the eyes. --Alan Newman, American Chemical Society, Washington, DC<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Life After God</h2><p>A collection of stories explores the nature of spirituality in a fast-moving modern culture and its impact on human nature, beliefs, relationships, attitudes, hopes, fears, and dreams</p><p>Douglas Coupland is Canadian, born on a Canadian Air Force base near Baden-Baden, Germany, in 1961. In 1965 his family moved to Vancouver, Canada, where he continues to live and work. Coupland has studied art and design in Vancouver, Canada, Milan, Italy and Sapporo, Japan. His first novel, <i>Generation X</i>, was published in March of 1991. Since then he has published eleven novels and several non-fiction books in 35 languages and most countries on earth. He has written and performed for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford, England, and in 2001 resumed his practice as a visual artist, with exhibitions in spaces in North America, Europe, and Asia. 2006 marks the premiere of the feature film Everything's Gone Green, his first story written specifically for the screen and not adapted from any previous work. A TV series (13 one-hour episodes) based on his novel, "jPod" premiered on the CBC in January, 2008.Professional pulse-taker Coupland (Generation X, Shampoo Planet) here presumes to speak for and to a generation raised without religion. And by the end of this fragmentary, drifting fiction, he reaches out for transcendence and belief. It's one helluva stretch. The narrator of the eight linked sections of this affectless fiction (with their trendy, goofy titles) prematurely worries about aging and death. Memories of a failed marriage mingle with profiles of former ``X''ers discovering the harsher realities of adulthood. A primal experience at a local McDonald's on the day of a distant nuclear test nurtured odd fantasies of the final moment, and a year in a dingy hotel introduced the narrator to some unsavory headbangers and hustlers. His later life as a software salesman makes him envy the freedom of the birds and the miracle of flight. Other turning points include a car breakdown in the California desert with loads of illegal steroids in the trunk. The narrator's older sister, obsessed with Patty Hearst, one day disappeared, though he doesn't give up hope of finding her. His friends from brighter days in northwestern Canada are settling into their post- ironic 30s as apocalyptic Christians, bitter alcoholics, bored housewives, and sad AIDS victims: all are becoming the types of people they once mocked, with little love to keep them going. Coupland's typically callow social observations and wacky aphorisms fill out the narrative. His amateurish line drawings aspire to Zeitgeist design. And ``blank generation'' here seems to mean lots of empty space on the pages. Heavy silences and minimalist diction: Samuel Beckett made easy for the Beavis and Butt-head generation. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The columns were later collected into a set of books published between 1951 and 1958. Vita's extensive gardening knowledge, her intense passion for her subject and her lively literary flair make these classics of garden writing essential for any serious gardener's bookshelf. Volume 1 in a series of four anthologies reproducing the lively gardening columns by Vita Sackville-West. This volume covers 1946&#x2013;1950.</p><p>Vita Sackville-West is known as much for her creation of the gardens at Sissinghurst Castle with her husband Harold Nicolson as for her numerous novels, which include The Edwardians and All Passion Spent, her collections of poetry and her gardening articles. A central figure in the Bloomsbury group of artists and writers, she was the model for Virginia Woolf&#39;s Orlando. She died in 1962.This month-by-month selection of Vita Sackville-West&#39;s gardening columns for the LONDON OBSERVER evokes Andrew Marvell&#39;s restful phrase, &#34;a green thought in a green shade.&#34; Her setting is the English cottage garden; her values stated in 1940s shillings and pence; her relations with plants intimate, anthropomorphic, and correct in all British and Latin nomenclature. Today&#39;s backyard gardener may find it easier to listen to than to follow her advice on the common quince and the copper beech. (&#34;Oh, why,&#34; I cried to myself, &#34;don&#39;t we all plant even a short length of copper beech hedge!&#34;) But McTeer&#39;s elegant rendering of the wonderful diction and flair of the mistress of Sissinghurst Castle is the perfect accompaniment to an afternoon of summer gardening, or, better yet, to the contemplation of a summer garden from the cool shade of a hammock.

Four children and a hard-working widowed mother live together on New Dollar Street in the village of Cranbury. Their seemingly quiet lives are studded with almost daily unexpected adventures, with droll results.<p> This charming book has been making readers smile for over half a century. It reflects a gentler era, when the jolly chief of police had time to sit on the curb to hear a little girl's "crimes" and a little boy's escapade on a train was not cause for media panic, just a simple redirecting by the agreeable engineer.

During the summer and fall of 2011, at the age of fifty-seven, Bruce Weber, an obituary writer for The <i>New York Times</i>, made the trip, alone, and wrote about it as it unfolded mile by mile, a vivid and immediate report of the self-powered life on the road.<br> <br>Now, expanding upon the articles and blog posts that quickly became a must-read adventure story, Weber gives us <i>Life Is a Wheel</i>, a witty, inspiring, and reflective diary of his journey, in which the challenges and rewards of self-reliance and strenuous physical effort yield wry and incisive observations about cycling and America, not to mention the pleasures of a three-thousand-calorie breakfast.<br> <br>The story begins on the Oregon coast, with Weber wondering what he&#x2019;s gotten himself into, and ends in triumph on New York City&#x2019;s George Washington Bridge. From Going-to-the-Sun Road in the northern Rockies to the headwaters of the Mississippi and through the cityscapes of Chicago and Pittsburgh, his encounters with people and places provide us with an intimate, two-wheeled perspective of America. And with thousands of miles to travel, Weber considers&#x2014; when he&#x2019;s not dealing with tractor-trailers, lightning storms, dehydration, headwinds, and loneliness&#x2014;his past, his family, and the echo that a well-lived life leaves behind. <br> <br>Part travelogue, part memoir, part romance, part paean to the bicycle as a simple mode of both mobility and self-expression&#x2014;and part bemused and panicky account of a middle-aged man&#x2019;s attempt to stave off, well, you know&#x2014;<i>Life Is a Wheel</i> is an elegant and beguiling escape for biking enthusiasts, armchair travelers, and any readers who are older than they were yesterday.</p><p>Bruce Weber, a reporter for <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, began his career in publishing as a fiction editor at <i>Esquire</i>.

While their nations fought battles with weapons, the four warlords of the twentieth century fought a war of the mind. Structured along the lines of a cinematic thriller, rapidly cutting from one man to the next, the book takes us blow by blow as they try to outthink and outfight each other. These encounters are told on a day-by-day, even hour-by-hour basis, affording unparalleled insights into parallel actions. Though there have been many single, and some dual, biographies, <i>no</i> previous book has put these four great figures together in this exciting and popularly appealing way. Moving from Whitehall and Washington to the Wolf's Lair and the Kremlin, <i>Warlords</i> documents the psychological battles among the leaders and shows how their thoughts and actions changed history.</p><p><b>Simon Berthon</b> is a distinguished writer and producer of historical documentaries and is the author of <i>Allies at War</i> . <b>Joanna Potts</b> has worked on a number of television series including <i>Empire</i> by Niall Ferguson.Recounting WWII from the point of view of the era's four political giants is an original idea, and it works: while not exactly revisionist, Berthon and Potts's book delivers some good jolts. Where popular writers often portray the good guys, Churchill and Roosevelt, as friendly partners, the authors refuse to soft-pedal controversies that erupted after America declared war&#x2014;especially over Churchill's reluctance to support a cross-Channel invasion and F.D.R.'s pressure on Churchill to free Britain's colonies. Readers will wince to be reminded of Roosevelt's conviction that Britain's imperial ambitions were a greater threat than Stalin's and his belief that Stalin was a sensible fellow one could do business with. Those accustomed to the stirring History Channel depiction of WWII as a crusade against evil will cringe to read of Stalin's persistent, insulting treatment of his allies and of the unspeakable atrocities he committed against his own countrymen. Using diaries, correspondence and personal accounts, the book cuts back and forth among its subjects as they direct the war. This cinematic style succeeds (the authors work in British TV), and the scholarship is solid&#x2014;so solid that readers convinced WWII was less squalid than other wars may be provoked to reconsider. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Charley hasn't seen his mother for years, and his father is hiding out in the mountains somewhere, with the other Free Humans. The Hoots own the world, but the humans want it back.

I'm honored to have gotten an early look at it."<br>&#x2014;Glen David Gold</p><p>"Carol Emshwiller's <i>The Mount</i> is a wicked book. Like Harlan Ellison's darkest visions, Emshwiller writes in a voice that reminds us of the golden season when speculative fiction was daring and unsettling. Dystopian, weird, comedic as if the Marquis de Sade had joined Monty Python, and ultimately scary, <i>The Mount </i>takes us deep into another reality.

Nearly every sentence is simultaneously hilarious, prophetic, and disturbing. This person needs to be really, really famous."<br> &#x2014;Paul Ingram, Prairie Lights Bookstore</p><p>"Brilliantly conceived and painfully acute in its delineation of the complex relationships between masters and slaves, pets and owners, the served and the serving, this poetic, funny and above all humane novel deserves to be read and cherished as a fundamental fable for our material-minded times."<br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Adult/High School - This veteran science-fiction writer is known for original plots and characters, and her latest novel does not disappoint, offering an extraordinary, utterly alien, and thoroughly convincing culture set in the not-too-distant future. Emshwiller brings readers immediately into the action, gradually revealing the takeover of Earth by the Hoots, otherworldly beings with superior intelligence and technology. Humans have become the Hoots' "mounts," and, in the case of the superior Seattle bloodline, valuable racing stock. Most mounts are well off, as the Hoots constantly remind them, and treated kindly by affectionate owners who use punishment poles as rarely as possible. No one agrees more than principal narrator Charley, a privileged young Seattle whose rider-in-training will someday rule the world. The adolescent mount's dream is of bringing honor to his beloved Little Master by becoming a great champion like Beauty, his sire, whose portrait decorates many Hoot walls. When Charley learns that his father now leads the renegade bands called Wilds, he and Little Master flee. This complex and compelling blend of tantalizing themes offers numerous possibilities for speculation and discussion, whether among friends or in the classroom."<br>&#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i><br><br>"Emshwiller's prose is beautiful"<br>&#x2014;Laura Miller, <i>Salon</i></p><p>"<i>The Mount </i>is a brilliant book.

And like her work in romance and westerns, its genre-twisting plot resists easy classification."<br>&#x2014;The Village Voice</p><p>"Emshwiller uses a deceptively simple narrative voice that gives <i>The Mount</i> the style of a young-adult novel. But there's much going on beneath the surface of this narrative, including oblique flashes of humor and artfully articulated moments of psychological insight. The Mount emerges as one of the season's unexpected small pleasures."<br>&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>"A memorable alien-invasion scenario, a wild adventure, and a reflection on the dynamics of freedom and slavery."<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"A brilliant piece of work."<br>&#x2014;<i>Bookslut</i></p><p>"...a beautifully written allegorical tale full of hope that even the most unenlightened souls can shrug off the bonds of internalized oppression and finally see the light."<br>&#x2014;<i>BookPage</i></p><p>"A fable/fantasy/cautionary tale along the lines of, say, <i>Animal Farm.</i> It's the story of Charlie, a preadolescent human who's being used as a horse by shoulder-riding alien invaders known as Hoots. Charlie wants nothing more than to become a great Mount, a loyal slave and servant, until his father, a renegade Mount who has fled from the Hoots and now lives in the mountains, comes to take him away. Like so much of Emshwiller's work, <i>The Mount</i> asks difficult questions&#x2014;in this case, What is freedom? The issue is particularly appropriate at a time when "freedom" in America is increasingly defined as "security"&#x2014;freedom from uncertainty, freedom from fear, freedom from want.

The world was stunned when Vladimir Putin invaded and seized Crimea in March 2014. In the weeks that followed, pro-Russian rebels staged uprisings in southeastern Ukraine. The United States and its Western allies immediately imposed strict sanctions on Russia and whenever possible tried to isolate it diplomatically.</p><p>This sharp deterioration in East-West relations has raised basic questions about Putin's provocative policies and the future of Russia and Ukraine. Marvin Kalb, who wrote commentaries for Edward R. Murrow before becoming CBS News' Moscow bureau chief in the late 1950's, and who also served as a translator and junior press officer at the US Embassy in Moscow, argues that, contrary to conventional wisdom, Putin did not "suddenly" decide to invade Crimea. He had been waiting for the right moment ever since disgruntled Ukrainians rose in revolt against his pro-Russian regime in Kiev's Maidan Square. These demonstrations led Putin to conclude that Ukraine's opposition constituted an existential threat to Russia.</p><p> <i>Imperial Gamble</i> examines how Putin reached that conclusion by taking a critical look at the recent political history of post-Soviet Russia. It also journeys deep into Russian and Ukrainian history to explain what keeps them together and yet at the same time drives them apart.</p><p>Kalb believes that the post-cold war world hangs today on the resolution of the Ukraine crisis. So long as it is treated as a problem to be resolved by Russia, on the one side, and the United States and Europe, on the other, it will remain a danger zone with global consequences. The only sensible solution lies in both Russia and Ukraine recognizing that their futures are irrevocably linked by geography, power, politics, and the history that Kalb brings to life in <i>Imperial Gamble</i>.</p></p><p>This sharp deterioration in East-West relations has raised basic questions about the policies of Vladimir Putin and the future of Russia. Is Putin&#39;s ultimate goal the dissolution NATO and the end of Western influence and power in Eastern Europe? Or does he simply want to retain Russian influence and power in Ukraine? Imperial Gamble takes a critical look at the recent political history of post-Soviet Russia and Ukraine and journeys deeper into the past to more fully explain the roots of Russian nationalism and the reason why the Russian people support Russia&#39;s controversial actions in Ukraine.

For the early settlers the sight of a funnel cloud was an unearthly event. They called it the &#x201c;Storm King,&#x201d; and their descriptions bordered on the supernatural: it glowed green or red, it whistled or moaned or sang. In <i>Storm Kings,</i> Lee Sandlin explores America&#x2019;s fascination with and unique relationship to tornadoes. From Ben Franklin&#x2019;s early experiments to the &#x201c;great storm war&#x201d; of the nineteenth century to heartland life in the early twentieth century, Sandlin re-creates with vivid descriptions some of the most devastating storms in America&#x2019;s history, including the Tri-state Tornado of 1925 and the Peshtigo &#x201c;fire tornado,&#x201d; whose deadly path of destruction was left encased in glass.<br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on memoirs, letters, eyewitness testimonies, and archives, Sandlin brings to life the forgotten characters and scientists who changed a nation&#x2014;including James Espy, America&#x2019;s first meteorologist, and Colonel John Park Finley, who helped place a network of weather &#x201c;spotters&#x201d; across the country. Along the way, Sandlin details the little-known but fascinating history of the National Weather Service, paints a vivid picture of the early Midwest, and shows how successive generations came to understand, and finally coexist with, the spiraling menace that could erase lives and whole towns in an instant.</p></p><p><p>Lee Sandlin is the author of&nbsp;<i>Wicked River</i>,&nbsp;<i>Storm Kings</i>, and The&nbsp;<i>Distancers</i>.

It&#x2019;s about a cowboy who has a terrifying vision: he sees the souls of damned cowboys riding through the night in an eternal chase after a stampede of supernatural cattle. One of these spectral cowboys breaks off the pursuit long enough to warn the singer to repent his evil ways, or else, after he dies, he will join them &#x201c;trying to catch the Devil&#x2019;s herd across these endless skies.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#x2019;t remember my father ever connecting this stampede to tornadoes. But then, he didn&#x2019;t have to. I made the connection myself the first time I heard him sing the song, and it&#x2019;s stayed with me ever since. He was constantly telling me scary stories about tornadoes. He made them sound like a regular feature of his childhood landscape. The way he described it, anywhere on the Great Plains, if you raised your eyes to the horizon, you might somewhere in the vast flat distance see a funnel cloud beginning to form. He talked about all the different and bizarre shapes they took: grand swooping curves of impossible architecture, furious little whirlwinds like the clouds of dust above cartoon fistfights. He repeatedly told me about the closest call he&#x2019;d ever had with a tornado&#x2014;a blustery summer day when he and his friends had been playing baseball and a tornado had come roaring across the outfield; they&#x2019;d had to hide in the dugout, clinging to the underside of the bench, to keep from being sucked into the funnel. But his favorite stories were about the nights he and his family had spent cowering in their snug lantern-lit storm cellar as the world outside had torn itself apart in the frenzy of a prairie thunderstorm: at some point his mother would raise a finger for silence, and they&#x2019;d hear amid the roar of the wind and the crashes and bangs of thunder a sinister new sound, a deep throbbing and a high-pitched shriek like an airplane engine revving up. &#x201c;And that,&#x201d; my father would conclude with satisfaction, &#x201c;was the tornado.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was spellbound by these stories, but I was also baffled by them. I never got that clear an idea of what a tornado really was. We lived then in northern Illinois, a place that was supposedly tornado heavy, but I had only seen one unmistakable tornado in my life, and that was in The Wizard of Oz. Few sights in any movie, or for that matter in the real world, have ever scared me as deeply as that. My father had no patience for it, though. He passed through the living room as my mother and brother and I were staring at the television screen in rapt horror, and he lingered only long enough to emit a snort of contempt. &#x201c;Nah, that&#x2019;s no tornado,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You should see a real tornado.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>Each spring the science class at my elementary school would spend a day on the subject of tornadoes. The teacher would show us a filmstrip that had a lot of cartoon images of spiral-shaped clouds looming over prairie farmhouses. There were also photographs of crew-cut men with white shirts, black ties, and horn-rimmed glasses, clustered in muddy fields around weather balloons. But only a few of the images were of actual tornadoes; in those days, the 1960s, a clear photograph of a tornado was as rare as one of a flying saucer.<br>&nbsp;<br>The filmstrip&#x2019;s narrator instructed us solemnly on the rules of tornado safety. There was one infallible warning sign that a tornado was coming, he said: the clouds took on a greenish glow. Tornadoes also caused an electrical disturbance that could be picked up by some TV sets, so if your TV screen grew mysteriously brighter during a storm, that was a clear signal a tornado was somewhere nearby. Then he explained why tornadoes were so destructive: there was a near vacuum at the heart of the funnel, so when it passed overhead, the air pressure trapped inside your house burst outward like an explosion. The most sensible precaution you could take, therefore, was to open your windows to equalize the air pressure. After you did so, only then should you take shelter, and the one safe place to hide was the southwest corner of the basement.<br>&nbsp;<br>The viewing of this filmstrip turned me into a kind of amateur tornado warden. Whenever there was a storm, I kept my eyes peeled for the warning signs. But where were they? Spring after spring, tornado season after tornado season, I never saw a hint of a green glow in the sky. The closest I came to a tornado was one sultry April afternoon when I was twelve: a severe storm came through the Chicago suburbs, and a tornado touched down several miles away. The next day the newspapers ran an amateur photograph: it showed a blurry smear of buildings and streetlights, while against the horizon stood an indistinct gray cone of smoke towering up to the sky like a supervillain menacing a cartoon city. I tore it out of the paper and tacked it up on my bedroom wall, as though it were a wanted poster.<br>&nbsp;<br>I did reports for school on tornadoes; I had all the key tornado facts memorized so that I could talk about wind speeds and air pressure with the least provocation. One afternoon in late spring when I was twelve, a storm built up in the west, and the sky around it turned a weird sickly yellow. My teacher, who knew about my obsession&#x2014;pretty much everybody in the school did&#x2014;asked me seriously whether that color sky meant a tornado was coming. I said authoritatively that yellow skies meant hail; green was the color of tornadoes. It was the proudest moment of my life.<br>&nbsp;<br>I even had dreams about tornadoes. The dreams were all pretty much identical: they began with a feeling of horrible dread. I knew, with absolute certainty, that a tornado was approaching. I couldn&#x2019;t see it; nothing about the scene looked sinister; but it was already too late to escape. Sometimes I&#x2019;d be the only one who knew, and I&#x2019;d try in vain to warn everybody of the imminence of disaster. It never did any good; nobody would pay any attention to me. The dream always ended the same way: I was standing at a window, looking out at the sky, all hope lost, and just as the tornado was about to appear, I&#x2019;d wake up.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think I was at the height of my tornado passion the summer I was twelve. That was when my family went to visit my father&#x2019;s old home in Oklahoma, where my grandmother still lived. I spent the whole drive there staring at the clouds and expecting each one of them to transform before my eyes into a tornado. But somehow Oklahoma proved to be deficient in tornadoes. The skies were a ceaseless stampede of white cumulus, and some of them did occasionally puff up into thunderheads, but there were no funnel clouds reaching down to touch the earth. The tabletop flatness of the plains was broken by nothing out to the horizon except oil derricks.<br>&nbsp;<br>I began to suspect that my father had been goosing his memories in order to scare me; he did always like scaring me. The night of our arrival, though, as we sat together on the front porch, a gigantic line of storms came rolling up over the southwestern sky. I had never seen anything in the world so large; it was like a tidal wave about to wash the plains clean. The sight inspired my father with something like nostalgia. This was just the kind of weather, he told me, that in his childhood had sent the whole family scurrying to the storm cellar for the night.<br>&nbsp;<br>Did that mean there would be a tornado? I asked. It was the wrong question. I couldn&#x2019;t keep a quaver of fear out of my voice, and however much my father liked to scare me, I was supposed to bear up under it with stoic impassivity. He soon clumped off to bed and left me to the view. I watched for several minutes more as the storm advanced. Little flickers of yellow lightning were bursting silently all along the billows and crests like artillery fire; by the time I went to bed, I could hear the first mutterings of thunder.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later that night I woke to find that the storm was exploding directly over my head. The thunder was making the walls quiver; the wind was in a fury, and it felt as if necessary things in the house were all bending over and were about to break. Rain rattled the windows like peltings of glass beads. The lightning bolts flared like searchlights. I went stumbling out of bed in a panic and fell forward down the hallway toward my parents&#x2019; room. I had the idea that we might have only a few minutes to reach the storm cellar. But at their door I froze; as frightened as I was by the storm, my father scared me more. I huddled up against the doorway and strangely, unwillingly, fell asleep.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s where my parents found me in the morning. Neither of them made any remarks about it. If my father had figured out what had happened, there would have been hell to pay, but I caught a break. He and my mother both just assumed I&#x2019;d been sleepwalking.<br>&nbsp;<br>That morning my grandmother took me on a little tour of the house and the yard. I expected to find a scene of total devastation, but everything was in its place: all the trees still had their branches, the flowers were charmingly mussed and gleamed with raindrops. My grandmother made no acknowledgment of the storm at all; as far as I could tell, she thought it was just a typical summer shower. She was much more interested in showing off all the improvements my father had been making for her on the property. He had even installed an automatic sprinkler system so she could see her gardens watered while she watched from her favorite chair in the living room.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the back fence, though, there was a curious antique. The slope of a low green mound under a stand of trees was set with a weather-beaten door, like an escape hatch from a grave. My grandmother explained that this was the storm cellar. I eagerly asked to see it; she was baffled by my interest and seemed rather embarrassed to show me anything so quaint, but she swung the door up with practiced ease. A few crude wooden steps led down into the dark. My grandmother picked up a flashlight that was hanging on a post and was pleased to see that the batteries were still good. As we stooped together under the rooted, cool earth of the mound, she shone the light around for me. There were several shelves that held rows of glass storage jars; the glass was so cloudy and sooty it was impossible to tell what was in them. On one shelf was a box of corroded batteries, a stack of sooty candles, and a fossilized portable radio. In the middle of the dirt floor was a rotting table and a couple of half-collapsed chairs. The whole place looked as though nobody had bothered to take shelter there in decades.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>The basics of tornadoes are not especially mysterious. The simplest way to think about them is to picture a pot of water on a stove. The essential thing is that the burners on the stove are heating the pot from the bottom up. This means that a layer of hot water is forming below a layer of cold water. As a result, the hot water is rising up but is being blocked by the cold water above it. That&#x2019;s an inherently unstable arrangement. At a certain point, as the heat intensifies, bubbles will begin to float from the hot zone through the cold zone to the surface. But these bubbles don&#x2019;t pop into existence randomly, all through the pot&#x2014;at least not at first. Instead, a line of bubbles will appear in one specific place and rise up as though deliberately moving in single file.<br>&nbsp;<br>This line of bubbles is created by a process called convection. &#x201c;Convection&#x201d; is a term for the concerted movement of a small group of molecules within the larger shapeless mass of a fluid or a gas. Several different things can cause convection, but one of the most common is heat transfer. In the case of the pot on the stove, the column of rising bubbles is transferring the heat through the cold layer without disturbing the rest of the water. The column is formed in this way because it requires less energy than a diffused heating of all the molecules in the liquid, and the rule in the physical world is that whatever takes the least energy is the thing that happens. (Only as the heat from the burners continues to warm the water does the process of convection at last get overwhelmed, resulting in the general indiscriminate hubbub of a boiling pot.)<br>&nbsp;<br>The earth&#x2019;s atmosphere can be imagined in the same terms. Sunlight warms the earth, and the earth radiates the heat back out into the atmosphere; so it often happens that the lowest layer of air is warmer than the air directly above it. Convection columns will spontaneously arise in the atmosphere in order to transfer the hot molecules near the earth into the higher altitudes. These convection columns may take a variety of forms&#x2014;the most dramatic and violent being the tornado. A tornado can be thought of as a last-ditch safety valve; it comes into existence only when the atmosphere is growing catastrophically unstable. It&#x2019;s a kind of emergency self-regulating mechanism that funnels huge volumes of hot air upward as fast as possible and restores the atmosphere to equilibrium.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tornadoes can, in theory, form anywhere, and they have been observed all over the world (on every continent except Antarctica). But they are most common in the American prairie states. This is because of a fluke of geography. The extreme atmospheric instability that gives rise to the tornado generally happens only when a very large area of hot humid air is overrun by an equally large area of colder drier air. On other continents, the mountainous terrain tends to scatter flowing air masses into confused and irregular forms, but in the central plateau of North America, where the flat landscape extends for thousands of miles in all directions, vast air masses come into contact with each other with a kind of abstract purity as though in a continent-wide experimental laboratory. More than a thousand tornadoes touch down in America every year. This may seem like an appallingly large number, but in fact almost all these tornadoes are weak and brief-lived. The average tornado is less than a hundred yards wide, with winds well under a hundred miles an hour; it skims across the ground for a mile or two and dissipates without doing significant damage. Even in the area of the country where tornadoes are most common&#x2014;Oklahoma, Kansas, Iowa, the region known as Tornado Alley&#x2014;a really violent tornado is rare. My father&#x2019;s stories aside, the truth is that the majority of people in Tornado Alley go their whole lives without so much as glimpsing one.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>The history of the American interior is in part a history of tornadoes. It&#x2019;s a curious kind of history, though, in that it consists largely of obliviousness and denial. The truth is that while midwesterners are afraid of tornadoes, and lots of them grow up as I did, obsessed with them and having recurring nightmares about them, the Midwest has been settled, deve...</p></p><h2>More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</h2><p><p>All those who enjoyed shuddering their way through Alvin Schwartz's first volume of <em>Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark</em> will find a satisfyingly spooky sequel in this new collection of the macabre, the funny, and the fantastic.</p><p>Is it possible to die -- and not know it?

The setting of this exchange was Edinburgh, in a Victorian house surrounded by rhododendrons and a few leafy trees: an oak, several copper beeches, and a single specimen tree known variously as the dove tree or ghost tree. &#x201c;Popular with doves,&#x201d; said Isabel, adding, &#x201c;and, I assume, with ghosts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If looked at from above, as from an intrusive, snap-happy satellite, the garden would be seen to be bounded on one side by a tree-lined avenue and on its three other sides by a high stone wall. This wall was a highway for cats and for Brother Fox, the fox who lived somewhere nearby and with whom Isabel from time to time communed&#x2014;to the extent that foxes, in their reserve, will allow anybody to commune with them. The wall was also a parcelling-out, in neat rectangular shapes, of contested suburban territory&#x2014;mine here, yours there, this shared. Beyond that wall were further gardens; then came roads and buildings of grey or honey-coloured stone, spreading out like skirts until they reached hills on one side and sea on the other. This was the North Sea, cold, blue, lapping at the jagged edge of the country, a reminder of where Scotland lay in the true nature of things; a place that was mostly water and wind and high empty sky; a place where the land itself seemed to be an afterthought, a farewell gesture from Europe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel was seated in a chair and her young son, Charlie, now almost four years old, was at her feet, under the table, a place that he described as his office and where he did his office work. Jamie, her husband&#x2014;although she still thought of him as her lover&#x2014;was standing near the large window overlooking the garden. The whole family was present and had been thinking, from their various perspectives, about lunch.<br> &nbsp;<br> And thinking of other things too. In Isabel&#x2019;s case, she had been paging through a current affairs magazine in which she had come across an article on the return of cultural treasures. Unsurprisingly, this article touched on the Elgin Marbles: we want them back, said Greece&#x2014;everybody knew their position on that&#x2014;while the British Museum, with typical British skill at changing the subject, seemed to be talking about other things altogether. But it was not these much-discussed Marbles that concerned Isabel&#x2014;rather it was a paragraph about a Maori wood carving that long ago had been taken from a meeting house and had ended up in a museum in Berlin. This carving was of spiritual significance for the Maori and a request had been made for it to be returned to New Zealand. The holding museum said that it was considering the matter, but was still doing so two years after the request had first been made. That was the point at which Isabel, reading about it before she got up to heat the soup for their lunch, said, aloud, &#x201c;Give it back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She had not addressed anybody in particular, although the advice appeared directed to the museum in Germany. It was one of those comments that we may utter to express strong views and that we do not expect to be overheard or reacted to. But Charlie heard it, and thought that his mother was telling him to give back the roller-ball pen that he had found and with which he was now beginning to draw small lines, tiny tattoos, across his kneecaps. He saw no reason to return the pen as it was his knees on which he was drawing; he understood that there was a general prohibition against graffiti, but this was himself he was decorating and that, he thought, was his business. It was for this reason that he said, &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Not knowing any of this, Jamie had interjected with his &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel glanced under the table and saw what Charlie was doing. &#x201c;Not on your knees, darling,&#x201d; she said, slipping him a piece of paper. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t draw on our knees, do we? Draw on that. Draw a fox.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The idea appealed, and the knee tattoos were forgotten. She looked at Jamie. &#x201c;I was reading about a carving in a museum that people want returned.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie nodded. &#x201c;Oh yes. But wouldn&#x2019;t it empty all the museums if we started to hand things back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It would diminish them, perhaps&#x2014;not empty them. Most museums have more things than they can show. The big ones have vast warehouses packed with treasures.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie peered at a thin rime of dirt on the window glass. An unusual wind had brought dust all the way up from the Sahara and dropped it across Western Europe, even as far as Scotland. He would have to wash the windows soon, as that was his job. Isabel was in charge of the garden, while Jamie did the windows and put the bins out on the street on collection days.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh yes?&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel laid aside her magazine. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s interesting,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;People like the Maori, and the Aboriginal people in Australia too, I suppose, see so many things about them as sacred. The land, the trees, river, carvings&nbsp;. . . And yet we don&#x2019;t have any of that ourselves, do we?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie peered even more closely at the glass. He had washed that particular window two or three weeks ago; winds from the Sahara had no business coming this far north. Who bids the mighty ocean deep/Its own appointed limits keep&nbsp;. . . The words came back to him unexpectedly; he had been a choirboy in his time and choirboys remembered what they were obliged to sing, or some of it. Winds had their appointed limits too, he thought, not just oceans.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe we had lots of sacred places,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And then we just forgot about them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel looked thoughtful. &#x201c;Stonehenge? Iona? Those odd stone circles that you sometimes more or less trip over?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. All of those.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just people like the Maori who have ancestors. What do they call the other New Zealanders&#x2014;the rest? People like Jenny?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It happened that Isabel knew. She had a New Zealand cousin who had visited her several times and they had shared a memorable conversation about belonging.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pakeha,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Maori word for&nbsp;. . . for us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pakeha have ancestors too&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie remembered Jenny&#x2019;s visit. &#x201c;I wonder what she&#x2019;s up to,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s writing a cookery book,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;And she still has that television show. The Creative Kitchen. She says that it&#x2019;s very popular in Spain, for some reason. She&#x2019;s dubbed into Spanish.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But it was not Jenny she wanted to talk about; it was what Jamie had said about ancestors. &#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We all have the same number of ancestors, don&#x2019;t we? We don&#x2019;t go on about them, but we have them, surely. I mean, there&#x2019;s no monopoly on ancestors. One can&#x2019;t be ancestor-rich, so to speak.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He left the window and came to sit down at the table, opposite Isabel. &#x201c;It depends on whether you think they exist. If you think that they&#x2019;re not there anymore&#x2014;because they&#x2019;ve died&#x2014;as ancestors tend to do&#x2014;then&nbsp;. . . well, then you can&#x2019;t really have them in your life, can you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So what counts, then,&#x201d; said Isabel, &#x201c;is whether you have an eschatological dimension to your Weltanschauung.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For the second time in those few minutes, Jamie said, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She laughed. &#x201c;Sorry, I couldn&#x2019;t resist it. You can get your revenge by saying something utterly opaque about Wagner, if you like. Or, perhaps more likely, somebody like Schoenberg.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Escha&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Eschatological,&#x201d; supplied Isabel. &#x201c;And I use it loosely, and just to keep you on your toes. It&#x2019;s more about last things, but I suppose the ancestors come into that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Put it simply,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, if you think that we survive in some way&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;After we&#x2019;ve kicked the bucket?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel hesitated, momentarily brought up sharp by the thought that there was a bucket waiting to be kicked by all of them&#x2014;including Jamie and Charlie; morbid thought, she told herself&#x2014;we&#x2019;re young, or sort of young. She decided to laugh, both at his use of the expression and as an act of defiance of mortality. &#x201c;To use a philosophical term of art,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Yes. If you think we survive death in some way, then you may well be concerned with ancestors. But that depends on whether you think they continue to have any interest in us. That&#x2019;s the important thing, I think.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You mean they may say, That&#x2019;s it, goodbye?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. And if they did, then there&#x2019;s no point in talking about the ancestors. Yet a lot of people don&#x2019;t think that way&#x2014;they feel there&#x2019;s some connection between their ancestors and themselves. They still feel somehow involved with them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Watching over us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She thought so. &#x201c;Or still occupying the places where they lived,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Hence the spiritual significance of place. Holy mountains&#x2014;that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie nodded. &#x201c;Some of my friends who play rugby talk about Murrayfield Stadium as sacred turf.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, it is a special place for them, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Rugby is such a tribal game. All those men getting physical with one another. Painting their faces with the Saltire. Singing &#x2018;Flower of Scotland.&#x2019; Bagpipes. Pure tribalism, surely.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They were both silenced, perhaps by the realisation that anthropological observation applies as much to us as to them. From under the table there came a faint humming. They both recognised it at the same time as &#x201c;Pop Goes the Weasel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He loves that tune,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;Half a pound of tuppenny rice, Charlie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A small voice responded tunefully, &#x201c;Half a pound of treacle.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie continued the nursery rhyme: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way the money goes.&#x201d; And Isabel said, &#x201c;That means nothing to him. He has no idea of money yet&#x2014;lucky him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Expensive,&#x201d; said Charlie.<br> &nbsp;<br> They looked at one another in astonishment.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Prodigy,&#x201d; whispered Jamie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Porridge,&#x201d; came the small voice from below.<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel winked at Jamie. &#x201c;His ancestors&#x2014;his Scottish ancestors&#x2014;ate an awful lot of porridge. Porridge links us to them.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Porridge binds.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie remembered something. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that person you keep quoting&#x2014;the one who wrote that book? The Art of Living?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lin Yutang.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, him. You once told me something that he said about patriotism and food. What was it again?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel smiled at the recollection. She had not read Lin Yutang for some time, but she knew where he was on her bookshelf. That, she felt, meant that he had not been forgotten. &#x201c;He said: What is patriotism but love of the food one ate as a child?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He thought about that. &#x201c;Very good. Yes, spot on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But she was not so sure; Isabel was a philosopher, and philosophers were distrustful of broad propositions. &#x201c;Well&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;You love your country because it&#x2019;s your country, because it&#x2019;s familiar and it&#x2019;s full of things you&#x2019;ve always known. That includes childhood food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel was prepared to concede that this came into it, but was it enough to explain why people&#x2014;or some of them, at least&#x2014;were prepared to sacrifice everything for their country, even their lives? But food was just a shorthand expression for the familiar. Was patriotism, when boiled down, merely a love of one&#x2019;s own familiar things&nbsp;. . . above the familiar things of others? The familiar things of others, of course, counted for less, it seemed: people were usually patriotic in the face of the assertions of others&#x2014;who also loved what they ate in their own, foreign childhood.<br> &nbsp;<br> But even that, she suspected, was a reduction too far. What about people who were patriotic because they loved the values their country espoused? She remembered, as she asked the question, a conversation she had had years earlier with an elderly man in the Scottish Arts Club. They had got on to the subject of national characteristics and he had revealed that as a refugee from Central Europe he appreciated the kindness and tolerance he had found in Britain. &#x201c;That is why I have become a British patriot,&#x201d; he had said. People had forgotten that there had been many who thought that way.<br> &nbsp;<br> She expressed her doubts to Jamie. &#x201c;I think the food of childhood is probably just a metaphor for one&#x2019;s people and place. I think that lies at the heart of patriotism. Our own people, our own place&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what stirs patriotism.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie looked thoughtful. &#x201c;Maybe. But it sounds so neat and tidy, doesn&#x2019;t it? It sounds so apt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All aphorisms do. They must have a kernel of truth in them&#x2014;somewhere&#x2014;but they often don&#x2019;t provide the full picture.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;I can imagine somebody like Lin Yutang getting up in the morning and thinking: What aphorisms shall I come up with today?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie laughed. &#x201c;Like Oscar Wilde, perhaps? Can&#x2019;t you imagine him getting out of bed in the morning and asking himself what witticisms he should let slip by breakfast.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Although I somehow doubt that Wilde got out of bed in the morning. These people tended to get up in the afternoon, I think. Look at Proust&#x2014;also a rather louche character. He got out of bed in the evening, if at all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right&#x2014;afternoon, then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, I can picture it. Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s last words, of course, were very well chosen. I can see him lying there in Paris, contemplating the wallpaper with distaste, and thinking It&#x2019;s almost time, I&#x2019;d better come up with something good. And then saying, &#x2018;Either that wallpaper goes, or I do.&#x2019; And then he went.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;Except for one thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie grinned. He would have liked Oscar Wilde, he thought&#x2014;in small doses. But it would have been exhausting to listen to him for too long. That was the trouble with very witty people&#x2014;they tire the rest of us. Boswell, he had always imagined, must have found it rather wearying to be in Dr.&nbsp;Johnson&#x2019;s company day after day on their trip through Scotland. Oh just shut up, will you, we&#x2019;ve got miles to go and you keep coming up with these wise observations&nbsp;. . . <br> &nbsp;<br> He frowned. &#x201c;One thing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t his actual last words. Apparently he said that a few weeks before he died.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie shook his head. &#x201c;Nice try, though.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel brought the conversation back to Lin Yutang. She would look for his book that evening, she decided. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else Lin said that I must look up. He wrote an essay on flowers, I seem to recall, and he lists the conditions that displease flowers. Isn&#x2019;t that a marvellous notion&#x2014;that flowers should be displeased by certain things?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Flowers with attitude,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;Sure. But what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember everything on the list&#x2014;in fact, I can only remember one thing he said flowers definitely don&#x2019;t like.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Which is?&#x201d;<br> ...</p><h2>Preparing for the Regents Examination Algebra 2 and Trigonometry</h2><p>Preparing for the Regents Examination Algebra 2 and Trigonometry is a comprehensive review book designed to help students prepare for the New York State Regents Examination, Algebra 2 and Trigonometry.

Although its extent has been drastically reduced, intact prairie remnants exist, prairie species persist along roadsides, and interest in prairie reconstruction has increased. The basic prairie matrix is formed by grasses, yet their diversity and beauty are often underappreciated because their flowering structures are highly reduced to aid in wind pollination. This much-needed addition to Iowa&#x2019;s popular series of laminated guides&#x2015;the twenty-sixth in the series&#x2015;illustrates fifty-five grass species characteristic of or commonly found on prairies of the Upper Midwest states of Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.<br><br> The authors have organized species into groups by their most easily noted field characteristics. Are the flowering heads branched or unbranched? Are the branches dense, narrow, or fingerlike? For each species, its native or exotic status is followed by the months of flowering, abundance, general habitat, height, diagnostic features, geographic range, and, if relevant, threatened or endangered status.<br><br> Even amateur naturalists can identify big and little bluestem and prairie dropseed in the field, but both professional and amateur naturalists find certain grasses harder to identify, especially the less common or rare species such as cluster fescue and sand reedgrass.

She has four cats, three brothers, two daughters, and one house near Washington, D.C.PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;Children who have had bad dreams (or parents who have struggled to explain them away) will find solace and a solution in this story. A girl describes how, after a cuddly bedtime ritual with Mom, she and her sister drift off to sleep. When she has visions of scary sea monsters, her older, wiser, and very patient sibling decides that it's time to relay The Secret that their mother had shared with her under similar circumstances: one has the power to reinvent one's dreams. Scary turns to silly and all is well until the older girl is invited to a sleepover and the narrator is frightened at the prospect of spending a night alone. Big sister comes through once again: she leaves a Dream Jar covered in blue paper and glow-in-the-dark stars and filled with ideas guaranteed to transform any nightmare. The predominantly blue palette is rendered in pencil and acrylic and manipulated in Photoshop. The text surrounding the nymphlike duo is occasionally hand lettered and/or appears in color. The overall design, including sketchy thought bubbles, irregularly shaped panels, and dynamic spreads, exudes the vitality, energy, and whimsy of a creative and sensitive family. A refreshing departure from the usual nocturnal sibling shenanigans and parental platitudes, this tale is perfect for bedtime, storytime, or anytime.

Her sons were both about to go off to war and all she could do was pray for their safety and hope to maintain her strength, until she unexpectedly came upon the perfect New Year's resolution-one that focused on others instead of herself. She would pray for a complete stranger every single day for a year.</p> <p>In <i>Praying for Strangers</i>, River Jordan tells of her amazing personal journey of uncovering the needs of the human heart as she prayed her way through the year for people she had never met before. The discovery that Jordan made along the journey was not simply that her prayers touched the lives of these strangers, but that the unexpected connections she made with other people would be a profound experience that would change her life forever.</p> Watch a Video</p><p><b>River Jordan</b>'s writing career began as a playwright where she spent more than ten years with the Loblolly Theater Group. She is the author of three critically acclaimed novels. She speaks and teaches around the country and produces and hosts her own radio show from Nashville, Tennessee, where she and her husband live.In this memoir, Jordan (Saints in Limbo) recounts stories of a year in which, when both of her sons were deployed to war zones, she decided to pray for a complete stranger every day. The results were extraordinary, as time after time she was led to pray for the stranger who needed it most: a nurse whose husband just had surgery, a teenager with visible bruises on her neck and arms, a young soldier coming home to a newborn daughter. Jordan writes eloquently about her experiences and the lessons she learned, but ultimately the book grows repetitive; with no context or depth given to these strangers, their stories run together and lose their distinctiveness. Additionally, with little context given to Jordan&#39;s own life and activities, the book reads more like a diary than a cohesive narrative, and her habit of ending every chapter with neat, tidy conclusions and moralizing contributes to this choppy, disconnected effect. Regardless, the idea of praying for strangers is admirable, and a reader looking for inspiration may find hope and grace in this account of the blessings of a prayerful life.

By the seventeenth century the complex pictorial language of alchemical symbols had reached a high point of elaboration and beauty. With the spread of printing, the whole fantastic iconography flowered as never before. This magnificent book presents a selection of the finest alchemical engravings, brought together for the first time. The best engravers of the age--the De Bry family, Merian, De Hooghe, and others--worked to interpret the haunting emblems of Lambsprinck and Michael Maier, the profundities of the wordless <i>Mutus Liber</i>, or the Christian mysticism of Jacob Bohme. In his introduction and commentaries, the author investigates the origins of this visual tradition, interprets the symbols, and provides information on authors, publishers, patrons, and engravers.</p><p>Stanislas Klossowski de Rola is the author of <i>Alchemy: The Secret Art.</i></p><h2>Full Verse Cross Reference Bible: NLT1 (Nlt Bibles)</h2><p>This Bible includes all appropriate cross-reference passages printed on the same page to bring fuller meaning and understanding to the Bible.

It tells in a brilliant braid of voices the story of an unnamed narrator who traces, before our rapt eyes, his memories of work, adventure, and travel as he undergoes medical tests and treatments for a condition that is rendering him more and more dependent on the loved ones who are caring for him. The narrator&#x2019;s memories and preoccupations often echo those of our current moment&#x2014;for here are stories of immigration and community, inclusion and exclusion, suspicion and trust. But at the book&#x2019;s core, and his, is family&#x2014;his relationships with those he loved, and with the natural world around him. Vivid, haunting, and deeply moving, <i>Spy of the First Person </i>takes us from the sculpted gardens of a renowned clinic in Arizona to the blue waters surrounding Alcatraz, from a New Mexico border town to a condemned building on New York City&#x2019;s Avenue C. It is an unflinching expression of the vulnerabilities that make us human&#x2014;and an unbound celebration of family and life.</p><p><b>SAM SHEPARD</b>&nbsp;was the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of more than fifty-five plays and three story collections. As an actor, he appeared in more than sixty films, and received an Oscar nomination in 1984 for&nbsp;<i>The Right Stuff.</i> He was a finalist for the W. H. Smith Literary Award for his story collection&nbsp;<i>Great Dream of Heaven.</i> In 2012 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, received the Gold Medal for Drama from the Academy, and was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame. He died in 2017.1<br><br>Seen from a distance. That is, seeing from across the road, it&#x2019;s hard to tell how old he is because of the wraparound screen porch. Because of his wraparound shades. Purple. Lone Ranger. Masked bandit. I don&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s protecting. He&#x2019;s actually inside an enclosed screen porch with bugs buzzing, birds chirping, all kinds of summer things going on, on the outside&#x2014;butterflies, wasps, etc.&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s very hard to tell from this distance exactly how old he is. The baseball cap, the grimy jeans, the old vest. He&#x2019;s sitting in a rocking chair, as far as I can tell. A rocking chair that looks like it was lifted from a Cracker Barrel. In fact, it still has the broken security chain around one leg. I think from this distance it&#x2019;s red but it could be black, the rocker, some of these colors originate from the Marines, some of them from the Army, some from the Air Force, depends on the depth of one&#x2019;s patriotism, and he just rocks all day. That&#x2019;s all. Telling stories of one kind or another, little histories. Battle stories. People come by, and they see him sitting there on the porch in his rocker mumbling to himself. And they just walk up and sit down. They seem to know him somehow. At first they seem as though they don&#x2019;t, but then they do. Also there are other people who come by. Who come and go. One of them looks like it might be his son. Tall and lanky. One looks like it could be his daughter. Two of them look like they might be his sisters. They come and go from deep inside the house but it&#x2019;s very hard to tell from this distance how deep the house goes.<br><br>Robins are chirping approval. More or less. Robins are always chirping here, for some reason. I think mostly protecting nests. Protecting pale blue eggs. From crows and blackbirds. Swooping. Menacing birds trying to get their babies. Little robins with red breasts chirping madly trying to scare away the crows. Big bad birds.<br><br>2<br><br>They gave me all these tests. Way out in the middle of the desert. The painted desert. Land of the Apache. Land of the Saguaro. They gave me blood tests, of course. All kinds of blood tests testing my white corpuscles, testing my red corpuscles, testing one against the other. Then they tested my spinal column. They gave me a spinal tap even. They put me through MRIs. Tubes where they could look at my whole body to see if there was any paralysis in any bones or muscles. Cross-sections, sliced sections. X-rays. Ghostly pictures. And they looked at decay and they looked at all kinds of things and they couldn&#x2019;t come up with an answer until finally one guy, I think some kind of neurosurgeon, he had black hair and a white coat and glasses, electric probing shocks with a steel rod. He injected them into each arm and an electric current pulsed through and I could feel these shocks in my arms. He&#x2019;s the one who came up with the answer that something was wrong. And I said, well, I know something is wrong. Why do you think I&#x2019;m in here? He just looked at me with a blank stare.<br><br>In the mornings I would have breakfast at a Mexican joint. Enchiladas. Cheese and eggs. Green chili.<br><br>3<br><br>There used to be orchards as far as the eye could see. Like picture postcards. Orange orchards, olive orchards, grape orchards, avocado orchards, lemon orchards, pear orchards. Orchards of every kind corresponding to the nationality that brought them here. For instance, the Italians and the Spanish brought oranges, avocados&#x2014;well, the avocados came up through Mexico&#x2014;tangerines, grapefruit, those kinds of things. The Italians brought olives. Out through Padua, sweeping silver leaves, limbs gnarled like old sailors. Black bark, silvery leaves. There were oceans of olive orchards everywhere. Way up in Chico there were almond orchards. Almond orchards that turned white in spring. Beautiful almond orchards that looked like Japanese calligraphy. Gorgeous. Walnut groves. Palm trees out in the Indio desert. Tall. Really tall. Some of them 100 feet or more. There was a border town between California and Arizona. The Colorado River ran through it. It was 1953 and white men used to dress up as Arabs on camels and parade back and forth in the street wearing Shriner caps pretending to be full of Arab pride. They were guys from the Midwest who owned barber shops and drugstores and had thick glasses. They had never seen the desert. I used to ride in the back seat of a Chrysler, right past the Colorado River with my aunt, my great-aunt who had blue hair and she was Welsh and her husband was fairly wealthy, but he had died by that time. His name was Charlie Upton, from Liverpool. And he had a penchant for whiskey and barroom brawls. In one of these fights he had his ear bitten off. Mike Tyson style. Bit right in half so that he only had one half an ear on one side of his face. I forget which side that was. But anyhow, he was wealthy enough to buy a Chrysler sedan on the black market during the War. Big heavy car. Beautiful car. Good for the open road. It had plaid seats. Plaid, not any other color but red plaid. I was all alone in a sea of plaid. It had an armrest that folded down in the middle of the back seat and behind each of the front seats was a kind of cord that went across, I suppose to support yourself for getting in and out of the vehicle if you were old. I wasn&#x2019;t that old then, maybe eight or nine, and my great-aunt who was my mother&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s sister, her name was Grace and she had blue hair. She would drive me out there to Indio to the date festival where we would get date shakes and watch the white men pretend to be Arabs on camels parading back and forth in the heat. From the tops of the 100-foot palm trees you could see parrots peeking out. Red. Black. And green. Date shakes, imagine that.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a place along the way that always made me feel peaceful and I don&#x2019;t know why. There&#x2019;s a wharf behind it. The wharf leads out to the Pacific. The wharf creaks and moans. Sometimes it chatters and thuds when cars cross it. The timbers rattle. Sand covers the sidewalk. Sand blown in from the beach. Surfers twelve years old or maybe thirteen carry their boards under their arms coming home in the twilight. Bermuda shorts on, hair all oily, covered in sand. Small dogs walk behind them. Small dogs of no significant breed. Pelicans cling to the wharf. Seagulls swoop. Sandpipers hum and sing and dance their little dance. The seaweed is soaking. Far in the distance two people are getting up from the beach just in bathing suits folding a huge orange towel. The squirrels are scurrying for cover. The sun is setting on the Pacific. People are unlocking their cars from a distance. Pushing buttons, zapping their cars, making the doors buzz and sing, making little Close Encounters of the Third Kind noises. People are getting in and starting their cars, driving out of the parking lot under the palm trees, past the lawns, past the glassed-in sitting rooms where blond women are serving them lobster. Somebody is turning off a lawn mower. Somebody&#x2019;s sitting at a bus stop. Somebody&#x2019;s waiting for somebody. Lights are coming on. They&#x2019;re starting to serve dinner. They&#x2019;re bringing steaming pots of something. Something like crab. Something like cod. Bowls full of cod. Bowls full of hot rice. People are going home. Somebody is waiting for somebody. Somebody&#x2019;s waiting for a bus. Everybody&#x2019;s waiting for somebody to take them out of there&#x2014;to take them far away. Down below they&#x2019;re just starting to swim and it&#x2019;s not even really dark yet but they are starting. Old men starting to drink. Young women are smoking cigarettes. The boats are rocking back and forth, back and forth. Bells are chiming. Some boats are unloading nets. Nets full of octopus spilling on the wharf. Somebody&#x2019;s waiting.<br><br>But inside this room they&#x2019;re laying down plates full of oyster, plates full of lobster. Steaming fish and rice. They&#x2019;re pouring huge glasses full of beer. Moving toward the windows, someone comments on the race. I do remember this. Someone says, &#x201c;A horse has been shot. The leader. The lead horse has been shot. A jockey is down on the ground. There goes the morning line.&#x201d;<br><br>4<br><br>I&#x2019;m not normally a suspicious person. I don&#x2019;t go around looking over my shoulder for surprises. But I have the sense&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t help having the sense&#x2014;that someone is watching me. Someone wants to know something. Someone wants to know something about me that I don&#x2019;t even know myself. I can feel him getting closer and closer. I can hear breathing. I can tell he&#x2019;s male by the smell of his breath. I don&#x2019;t know what he wants. He gets more and more curious about my comings and goings. About me. He seems to want to know something about my origins.<br><br>5<br><br>Where exactly do we come from? That&#x2019;s one question. Was it a desert? Was it a forest? Was it a mountain? Was it the prairie? Where do we actually come from? The Colorado River?<br><br>If you were traveling in a foreign country and you lost your dogs and you lost your car and you lost your note from home that your mother pinned on your collar and you lost your clothes and you were standing there naked and somebody came up to you and said, where do you belong, how would you answer? Would you ask the one ancestor who happened to be Portuguese? Or would you ask the Spanish Armada? Somebody has forgotten.<br><br>6<br><br>To tell you the truth, I don&#x2019;t know where he came from. I discovered him quite by accident. Bent backwards, gasping for air. One day I was sitting here much the same way as he&#x2019;s sitting now, twiddling my thumbs, and I was looking out across the road and I saw this chair rocking back and forth and then I saw that somebody was in it. And there he was. He just appeared. I don&#x2019;t know whether he rented or bought the house and then invited his people there or whether they were already there and he came to visit them or whether he&#x2019;s on a short-term lease. I don&#x2019;t know exactly. Sometimes people appear like that out of nowhere. They just appear and then they disappear. Very fast. Just like a photograph that emerges from a chemical bath.<br><br>7<br><br>I&#x2019;m not sure what he&#x2019;s seeing now, the air is so hazy, I&#x2019;m not sure what I&#x2019;m seeing either. Whether he&#x2019;s talking to himself or talking to someone else or what exactly he&#x2019;s doing. The birds are not singing now. Fluffy white clouds all around but the air is still hazy. The trees are coming back to life. A pair of old red tennis shoes dangles from the telephone wires, hanging up there by shredded laces.<br><br>He eats cheese and crackers all day. Iced tea. He sips on that. But he has particular trouble with his hands and arms, I&#x2019;ve noticed. His hands and arms don&#x2019;t work much. He uses his legs, his knees, his thighs, to bring his arms and hands to his face in order to be able to eat his cheese and crackers. It seems that periodically he has to go to the bathroom or something. He stands. He wavers when he stands. He looks like he&#x2019;s going to fall over. Topple. It must be the reason for the handicapped sign hanging from the rearview mirror of his car in the driveway. He wavers from side to side. He signals. He looks like he might very well fall over, but he doesn&#x2019;t. Sometimes he calls for one of his people&#x2014;one of his sons or daughters or somebody else closely related to him like his sisters. He signals and they come out on the porch. In other words, he stands, he wavers, he does these things over and over again. Cheese and crackers, iced tea, reading. Then he calls somebody and they come and they tend to him. They take him inside the house. They take him by the arm and take him inside. He goes through a screen door into a dark house and disappears. There&#x2019;s no telling how deep the house goes. When he comes back, often with the same person, arm in arm, they either zip him up or zip him down. They zip up his pants. In other words he&#x2019;s done something very private. He&#x2019;s either urinated or gone number two and they help him with this. They help put him back together and then they stick him back in his rocking chair. They sort of gently lower him back down even though at a certain point he kind of falls into the chair backwards panting and gasping. He says, the more helpless I get, the more remote I become. Am I seeing all of this? The air is still hazy. You might ask yourself why. Why am I so interested. Is it pure curiosity or do I have some other motive. For instance, hired by some cryptic detective agency. Or is everything by accident?<br><br>8<br><br>Why is he watching me? I can&#x2019;t understand that. Nothing seems to be working now. Hands. Arms. Legs. Nothing. I just lie here. Waiting for someone to find me. I just look up at the sky. I can smell him close by.<br><br>9<br><br>It was that time of day that I love so much. That people have written songs about. The time of day when afternoon is turning to night. Twilight, I guess it&#x2019;s called, and I snuck across the road. I snuck across the road hoping to get a peek at him before he began any conversation with somebody unseen or seen. I crossed the road. It had been raining for three days straight. Raining. The street was still running with water. Water was coming down everywhere. Not rain but residual water. I got to the other side through the parked cars, through all kinds of parked cars. There were Toyotas, there were Chevys, there were Fords, there were Zumbayas. All kinds of cars and I got to the hedge which was neither a camellia hedge or a hydrangea or anything like that. It was unidentifiable. There were white flowers coming out of it but I didn&#x2019;t know quite what they were. I can make him out through the white flowers, through the hedge. But I wasn&#x2019;t quite sure. I could make something out through there, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure what. Oh never mind, I&#x2019;ll figure it out later. That&#x2019;s the thing about later. You don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s coming up. You don&#x2019;t know how all the loose ends are going to gather together. Something for sure is going to happen but you don&#x2019;t know what it is. For instance&#x2014;I&#x2019;m outside, for instance. Out here with the birds and the bugs. Not exactly outside, but close enough. Just across the way. It&#x2019;s never like it was. The clouds. The big sky. The flowers. The chirping.</p><h2>Yoga Journal&#39;s Yoga Basics: The Essential Beginner&#39;s Guide to Yoga For a Lifetime of Health and Fitness</h2><p><p>Welcome to the world of yoga.</p><p><i>Yoga Journal's Yoga Basics </i>offers the first truly comprehensive introduction to the practice of this popular ancient healing art. Produced by a teacher of yoga for over 25 years and the editors of <i>Yoga Journal</i>, it offers all the inspiration and instruction you'll need to develop your own at-home yoga practice. Beginning with an exploration of the roots of yoga, the book goes on to describe a variety of hatha yoga styles-- Iyengar, Ashtanga, Kundalini, and others-- so you can choose the method that's appropriate for you. Featuring easy-to-follow instructions and 140 black-and-white photographs to illustrate the postures, <i>Yoga Basics</i> provides a thorough understanding not only of the mechanics of technique but of all the important elements that make yoga so much more than a fitness regime. In this unique book you'll find:</p><p>* Tips on the use of the breath in yoga practice and breath awareness exercises<br>* Guidelines for regular practice, including health and safety considerations<br>* Dozens of illustrated postures-- standing, seated, supine, and prone-- with their benefits described<br>* Sample Yoga routines that can be done in as little as 15 minutes per day<br>* Instruction on the practice and power of meditation</p></p><p><p>The world-renowned, award-winning <i>Yoga Journal</i> is the premier yoga publication in this country and has produced a number of best-selling videos on yoga practice. <b>Mara Carrico</b> has more than a quarter century of experience teaching dance, movement therapy, and yoga and is the choreographer of <i>Jane Fonda's Yoga Exercise Workout</i> video. She writes frequently on the subject of yoga and Eastern disciplines and conducts workshops around the world.</p>Carrico, the choreographer of Jane Fonda's yoga video, and the staff of the well-respected Yoga Journal have produced both a good introduction to the history of yoga and helpful instruction in a range of basic poses.

She calls for moving away from the reconciliation paradigm that currently dominates interracial relations and embracing instead a <i>reparations</i> paradigm.<br><br>Harvey presents an insightful historical analysis of the painful fissures that emerged among activist Christians toward the end of the Civil Rights movement, and she shows the necessity of bringing "white" racial identity into clear view in order to counter today's oppressive social structures.<br><br>A deeply constructive, hopeful work, <i>Dear White Christians</i> will help readers envision new racial possibilities, including concrete examples of contemporary reparations initiatives.

They were first written down by a student of Lamperti in the 1890s. Lamperti had in turn learned them from his father, Francisco Lamperti, who gathered them from Presto, Bellini, Donizetti, Rossini, et al. The precepts that developed the great voices of the Golden Age of Song are made available in this edition to all vocal students and afficionados of today.</p><p></p><h2>Dead Line</h2><p>Here is the fourth installment in Stella Rimington&#x2019;s series of thrilling novels that have at their center MI5 officer Liz Carlyle.<br><br>As plans get under way for a Middle East peace conference at the Gleneagles resort in Scotland, alarming information comes to MI5 from a high-ranking Syrian source: two individuals are mounting an operation to violently disrupt the conference and lay the blame on Syria. No one knows who they are, exactly what they&#x2019;re planning or if they&#x2019;re working independently or being controlled by an unseen foreign hand. But given the stature of the conference attendees&#x2014;heads of state from the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Iran&#x2014;no chances can be taken.<br><br>Initially, the leads look promising, but as the conference deadline draws closer and the clues lead Liz to one seeming dead end after another, she begins to understand that the threat is far greater than she or anyone else has imagined. Her most reliable tool has always been her searingly keen intuition&#x2014;about what makes people tick, what makes them explode, what makes them defy the most basic constructs of society&#x2014;but will it be enough to avert a disaster that may forever erase the possibility of peace in the Middle East?<br><br>Once again, Stella Rimington brings her experience as the first woman Director General of MI5 to bear in a powerfully suspenseful, intellectually and psychologically riveting tale about how the war on terrorism can suddenly&#x2014;and continually&#x2014;reshape our world.</p><p>Stella Rimington joined Britain&#x2019;s Security Service (MI5) in 1969. During her nearly thirty-year career she worked in all the main fields of the Service&#x2019;s responsibilities&#x2014;counter subversion, counter espionage and counter terrorism&#x2014;and successively became Director of all three branches. Appointed Director General of MI5 in 1992, she was the first woman to hold the post and the first Director General whose name was publicly announced on appointment.

Rimington lives in London.<b>1<br><br></b>In his flat near the British embassy in Nicosia, Peter Templeton woke early. For a few minutes he lay staring at the ladder pattern on the wall of his bedroom made by the sun shining through the venetian blinds. Then, with an anticipatory jolt, he remembered the message he&#x2019;d received yesterday: the code word from Jaghir that called him to an urgent meeting. Templeton was MI6&#x2019;s head of station in Cyprus, and Jaghir was one of his most important agents. <br><br>There was little traffic in Nicosia this early, so when Templeton&#x2019;s black saloon pulled out of the car park beneath his block of flats it had the street to itself. But within thirty seconds a small, battered hatch-back swung round a corner and began to follow closely behind the saloon.<br><br>The two cars went south through the old walled city, a cautious convoy, avoiding the UN Green Line and the Turkish sector in the north. They took the narrow side streets, past old stone houses with ornate balconies, their tall wooden shutters still firmly closed, and shops that were not yet open for business. Driving through an opening in the old Venetian wall, former boundary of a once much smaller city, they crossed the Pedieos River. The two cars proceeded carefully, their drivers alert and tense; another vehicle could have followed their labyrinthine progress, but not without being detected.<br><br>As they emerged from the outskirts of the city, a hinterland of white concrete apartment blocks, the cars accelerated and drove on towards the Troodos mountains. Slowly the road began to climb, and at the base of the range it split, its main artery moving north around the mountain, a smaller track heading in a tortuous zigzag up the mountain itself. In the crook of the junction sat a small caf�, just half a dozen tables in a dusty courtyard under an overhanging <i>tourathes</i> rigged to block the sun.<br><br>Templeton lifted his hand briefl y from the wheel in a quick salute to his colleague, and drove on up the track. The hatchback pulled into the caf�&#x2019;s small parking lot and the driver got out to sit at a table, ordering a coffee when the proprietor emerged blinking in the bright light. But the driver&#x2019;s eyes watched the road he&#x2019;d come along. It was barely seven o&#x2019;clock and cooler here than in Nicosia, but already the temperature was nearly 90 degrees.<br><br>As Templeton made his way up the treacherous track that cut through the large stands of umbrella pines lining the mountainside, he kept an eye on his rear-view mirror, but all he could see was the cloud of dust his car was stirring up. It was just three miles to his destination, yet he knew it would take at least another fi fteen minutes. He manoeuvred carefully up the incline with its seemingly infinite twists and curves, catching glimpses through the trees of an ancient monastery ahead of him, nestled neatly into a wide ledge halfway up the mountain. Its walls of white ashlar blocks seemed to grow out of the mountain, enfolding a group of buildings, their tiled roofs aged over the years to a dark mocha brown.<br><br>After a final twist of the road, he reached the walls and, driving through an arch, he left his car parked at the base of a short, steep flight of steps. He climbed them slowly, allowing his eyes to adjust to the shade after the blinding sunlight of the hillside. At the top, on a long terrace tiled in white stone, he stopped and gazed down at the road he had come along. Beside him a roofed portico stretched to a large squat chapel with a cloister on one side, from which came the sound of the monks going to prayer. That would keep them occupied for the half hour Templeton required for his meeting.<br><br>He sat down on the ledge that overlooked the mountainside and the valley below, picking a shady corner where the terrace joined the portico. The air was scented by the dry, dropped needles of the pines and by the thyme growing in cracks in the walls. Perched here, he could see the caf�, not much bigger than a speck. As he waited, the mobile phone in his jacket pocket vibrated. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said quietly. He could hear the whirr of cicadas on the hillside below.<br><br>&#x201c;On his way. Alone so far.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Keep me posted.&#x201d;<br><br>He watched patiently, until far below him he saw dust kicking up in small clouds from the track, then a moving dot that gradually turned into a car, a Mercedes, grey with dust. The noise of its tyres grew louder as it came quickly up the track, and braked with a small squeal next to Templeton&#x2019;s car.<br><br>A moment later, an Arab in a smart light-grey suit appeared at the top of the stairs. He was in his forties, trim and thin, his hair short but expensively cut, and even in the heat his shirt was crisply pressed, the collar uncreased. Seeing Templeton, he came over to the corner, his eyes alert.<br><br>&#x201c;Salam aleikum, Abboud,&#x201d; said Templeton as he stood up to shake hands. He spoke classical Arabic, learned in six months&#x2019; intensive tuition at the language school in the hills outside Beirut, then honed to fl uency by twenty years of postings in the Middle East.<br><br>&#x201c; Aleikum-as-salam,&#x201d; the man named Abboud replied, then switched to English. &#x201c;We are alone, I take it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Entirely,&#x201d; said Templeton. He gave a small smile and nodded at the chapel. &#x201c;The brothers are all at prayer.&#x201d;<br><br>They sat on the ledge, Abboud peering warily down the mountainside. Templeton said, &#x201c;You must have something important to tell me.&#x201d; Their next meeting had not been due for a month, but the message from Abboud&#x2014;Jaghir&#x2014;had been unambiguously urgent.<br><br>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; said Abboud. He took a cigarette case from his pocket, waving it towards Templeton, who shook his head. Lighting a Dunhill with a gold lighter, Abboud inhaled deeply, then blew smoke in a long snow-coloured stream over the ledge. A hundred yards out a hunting kestrel hovered high over the mountainside, its wings fl uttering slightly to steady itself against the movement of the thermals. &#x201c;I was in Damascus last week. Tibshirani called me back.&#x201d;<br><br>Templeton nodded. Tibshirani was the deputy director of Idarat al-Mukhabarat, one of Syria&#x2019;s dreaded secret services, and Abboud&#x2019;s direct superior. He was a man who mixed intellectual sophistication (he had been a postgraduate student at Berkeley in California) and peasant brutality.<br><br>&#x201c;What did he want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We are having some problems with the Turks. They arrested one of our agents last month in Ankara. It could have consequences&#x2014;especially here in Cyprus.&#x201d; He took another drag on his cigarette. &#x201c;But that is not why I wanted to see you. I had dinner with Tibshirani on my second night. In the old quarter. No wives, though there was some other female entertainment.&#x201d; He gave the briefest fl icker of a smile. &#x201c;Afterwards Tibshirani started talking about another operation. I thought he was just drunk and being indiscreet&#x2014;he&#x2019;s known me since I joined the service&#x2014;but then the next morning in his office he briefed me formally about it.&#x201d;<br><br>He paused for a moment, looking down the mountain, then stood up to gain a better view. Satisfi ed that nothing was coming up the track, he sat down again on the ledge, throwing down his cigarette and grinding it out with the heel of his tasselled loafer.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve heard about these talks between my country and the Americans.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; replied Templeton. It was a sore point in Whitehall, since the British had been excluded from the discussions.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s commonly thought they are going nowhere&#x2014;without Israeli involvement, it&#x2019;s said, the Americans cannot agree to anything. If they do, the Jewish lobby will just block it in Congress. That&#x2019;s what the media says, at any rate.&#x201d;<br><br>This was true. The original enthusiasm that the two hostile governments were actually talking to each other had gradually given way to a widespread cynicism that nothing of consequence would emerge from the &#x201c;secret&#x201d; meetings the whole world now knew about.<br>&nbsp;<br>Abboud tugged at one of his cuffs and stared out at the arid valley towards Nicosia. The kestrel was lower in the sky now, moving patiently above the slope, like a gundog working a field. He said, &#x201c;I tell you, my friend, this time the <i>on dit</i> is wrong. For once talks may lead to something&#x2014;the administration in Washington seems determined to break the impasse in the Middle East at last, even if it means standing up to Israel. They want a legacy and they have chosen this to create it.&#x201d;<br><br>Was this why Abboud had called an urgent meeting? wondered Templeton. It was all interesting stuff, but hardly worth the risk each man had taken coming here.<br><br>Sensing Templeton&#x2019;s impatience, Abboud held out a reassuring hand. &#x201c;Do not worry&#x2014;I am coming to the point. I don&#x2019;t want to stay here any longer than I have to.&#x201d; He looked at his watch, a sliver of gold that glinted in the harsh, still-rising sun. &#x201c;In two months&#x2019; time there is going to be an international conference in Scotland. You may know about it. It has not attracted much interest so far because only the moderates have agreed to attend. But my government wants progress. We need a settlement for the stability of our country. So we have decided to attend. I am to be part of our delegation, which is why Tibshirani told me the story.&#x201d; He raised his eyes to the sky.<br><br>&#x201c;What story?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have information that certain parties are working to disrupt the process. We know of two individuals acting to prevent any peaceful solution to the current stalemate. They intend to blacken the good name of Syria and thus to destroy all trust at the conference.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How will they do that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. But I can tell you, my friend, that if they succeed there will be a bloodbath in the region.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know who they are, who is directing them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know they have connections to your country, and I know their names. But Tibshirani does not know who is controlling them. He does not think it is the British.&#x201d; He smiled, a gleam of white teeth in the sunlight. Then he gave Templeton two names, reciting each one twice, quite slowly, to make sure there was no misunderstanding. Nothing was committed to paper by either man.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Templeton, having memorised the two names. &#x201c;Where does this information come from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That I cannot tell you.&#x201d; Abboud laughed as he saw the irritation spreading across Templeton&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;But only because I do not know myself. Believe me, it&#x2019;s not worth my trying to find out; I already know more than I should. I believe it to be true, and so does Tibshirani. But listen to me; here is the most important thing. These people, these two parties who are working against us&#x2014;my colleagues are going to move against them before they can do harm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Move?&#x201d;<br><br>Abboud merely nodded. They both knew full well what this meant.<br><br>&#x201c;When will they &#x2018;move&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Soon, very soon. They will do it in the United Kingdom. Secretly. So it will not be known who has acted. My side does not want anything to disrupt this conference. We see much for Syria to gain&#x2014;we hope to get back our country from the Israeli invaders. So my superiors consider that action against these people is worth the risk if it keeps the conference alive. Personally, I fear that if they make a mistake it may have the opposite effect, which is why I am telling you. But now I must go,&#x201d; said Abboud, standing up.<br><br>Templeton stood up too, looking down the mountainside. The kestrel was no longer circling; it must have found its prey.</p><h2>After Dark</h2><p><p>Fifteen years ago Johnny Mack Cahill left his hometown of Noble's Crossing, Alabama without a penny to his name, vowing to never return.

What a team. I still can hardly believe that I got to work with them.<br> "In fact, a few weeks after he'd started working on the strip, Curt gave me a call to tell me how much he was enjoying it. He said it was just like working on a Sunday newspaper strip, which of course was the whole idea. Curt got it immediately. That wasn't too surprising. Curt always got it.<br> "And when Murphy joined us, that really put the icing on the cake. He also immediately got what we were doing. I'd written this ominous cliffhanger into the first strip that Murphy inked, and he later told me how much he loved it. And, having drawn the <em><b>Buck Rogers</b></em> newspaper strip, he knew from cliffhangers.<br> "So, to have Curt Swan and Murphy Anderson tell me that they liked drawing a Superman story that I was writing? That was an honor and a thrill, both at the same time. The only thing that came close was a few years later, when Jerry Siegel told me that he liked my writing.<br> "And Tom Peyer was a great, great help to me. Midway through the run, my schedule was getting more and more frantic. I was younger then, but even so, I was starting to run a little ragged.<br> "Now, I had known Tom for several years. I knew that Tom understood weekly deadlines, so I asked him to give me a hand with the strip.<br> "We'd go over my outline, and Tom would rough out the pacing and script for a few weeks at a time. Then, I'd make a final pass, writing a finished draft. I don't remember exactly when we started working together, but Tom was a godsend. When we were given the word that the weekly strip would be ending prematurely, Tom helped me re-pace things so we could wrap up the story in good fashion. And we'd no sooner done that, than we were told, 'Oh, you have an extra three weeks.' And we were already finished! Curt was already drawing those strips. <br> "I can laugh about it now, but it was maddening at the time. Fortunately, Tom came up with a great idea for a nice, tight little three-week story and we were able bring the series to a good end. But I wouldn't have been able to do it without Tom. Not unless I'd been able to give up sleeping for a few months.<br> "Anyway, that's the story of how Tom Peyer became my youthful prot�g�.

Only their preternaturally gifted fielder, Henry Skrimshander, seems to have the chance to keep his dream - and theirs, vicariously - alive, until a routine throw goes disastrously off course, and the fates of five people are upended.

Written with boundless intelligence and filled with the tenderness of youth, The Art of Fielding is an expansive, warm-hearted novel about ambition and its limits, about family and friendship and love, and about commitment - to oneself and to others.

He is currently the Executive Editor of n+1, which he co-founded, and lives in Brooklyn.</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2011</strong>: Though <i>The Art of Fielding</i> is his fiction debut, Chad Harbach writes with the self-assurance of a seasoned novelist. He exercises a masterful precision over the language and pacing of his narrative, and in some 500 pages, there's rarely a word that feels out of place. The title is a reference to baseball, but Harbach's concern with sports is more than just a cheap metaphor. <i>The Art of Fielding</i> explores relationships--between friends, family, and lovers--and the unpredictable forces that complicate them. There's an unintended affair, a post-graduate plan derailed by rejection letters, a marriage dissolved by honesty, and at the center of the book, the single baseball error that sets all of these events into motion. <i>The Art of Fielding</i> is somehow both confident and intimate, simple yet deeply moving. Harbach has penned one of the year's finest works of fiction.<i>--Kevin Nguyen</i></p>Chad Harbach grew up in Wisconsin, and graduated from Harvard in 1997.

They stood in the hallway next to the lockers with flat expressions, looking bored, while she clutched her backpack straps for security.</p><p>&#x201c;You barked at me yesterday,&#x201d; she continued, pinching her eyebrows together at Jared as Madoc smirked from behind him. &#x201c;And then all of your friends followed along. It&#x2019;s been forever, Jared. When are you going to stop? Why are you doing this?&#x201d;</p><p>I sucked in a long breath and completed my usual awesome combination of eye-roll-head-shake.</p><p>I really hated turning corners. I hated closed doors.

From the start of freshman year, they had both bullied her. They spread rumors, harassed her, and did everything they could to make her unhappy. They pushed, and she retreated time and again. It was starting to piss me off so much that I was about to go knock their heads together to defend her.</p><p>Except I barely knew her. And Tatum didn&#x2019;t know me at all. I stayed so far off the radar that sonar couldn&#x2019;t pick me up.</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Jared answered her question with a question and jutted into her space with a cocky swagger. &#x201c;Because you stink, Tatum.&#x201d; He scrunched up his nose in mock disgust. &#x201c;You smell . . . like a dog.&#x201d;</p><p>Tate straightened immediately, and the tears in her eyes finally spilled over.</p><p>Kick him in the balls, bitch!</p><p>Exhaling a furious breath, I pushed my glasses back up the bridge of my nose. It&#x2019;s what I did before I braced myself.</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even remember what today is, do you?&#x201d; She folded her trembling lips between her teeth and looked down at the ground.</p><p>And without even seeing her eyes, I knew what was there. Despair. Loss. Loneliness.</p><p>Without looking at him again, she turned around and walked off.</p><p>It would&#x2019;ve been easy to hit him. To toss an insult back at him. And while I despised her weakness, I understood one thing that I hadn&#x2019;t before. Jared was an ass, but he was an ass who could hurt her.</p><p>She was in love with him.</p><p>Crossing my arms over my chest, I walked over to the lockers where Jared and Madoc stood staring after Tate.</p><p>Madoc spoke up behind him. &#x201c;What did that mean? What&#x2019;s today?&#x201d;</p><p>Jared shrugged off the question. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what she was talking about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s April fourteenth,&#x201d; I piped up over Madoc&#x2019;s shoulder, causing him to spin around. &#x201c;That mean anything to you, Shit-for-Brains?&#x201d; I directed at Jared.</p><p>Madoc raised a dark blond eyebrow at me, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Jared twisted his head only enough so that I could see the side of his face.</p><p>&#x201c;April fourteenth?&#x201d; he whispered and then blinked long and hard. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>And Madoc reared back a hair as Jared slammed the palm of his hand into the nearest locker door.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; Madoc scowled.</p><p>Jared ran his hands down his face and then shook his head. &#x201c;Nothing. Never mind,&#x201d; he growled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Geometry.&#x201d; Stuffing his fists into his pockets, he stalked off down the hall, leaving Madoc and me.</p><p>Between my stepbrother and his friend, I respected his friend more. They were both Grade A assholes, but at least Jared didn&#x2019;t care what people thought of him. He stalked around like a weird cross between a jock and a goth. Popular and foreboding. Dark but extremely coveted.</p><p>Madoc, on the other hand, cared what everyone thought. Our parents. The principal. And most of the student body. He loved being loved, and he hated his association with me.</p><p>As sophomores they were already starting to wield power that was going to be out of control by the time they reached senior year.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, your friend is a loser,&#x201d; I teased, sliding my hands into the back pockets of my jeans.</p><p>Madoc zeroed in on me with his playful half-smile and relaxed eyes. &#x201c;So are your frien&#x2014;&#x201d; he started, then stopped. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s right. You don&#x2019;t have any friends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t need &#x2019;em,&#x201d; I shot back. &#x201c;I travel faster on my own. I&#x2019;m going places. You know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re going places. Just stop at the dry cleaners on your way, Fallon. I need my shirts picked up.&#x201d; He smoothed an arrogant hand over his navy Abercrombie button-down. With his medium-wash boot-cut jeans, black Paracord bracelet, and styled dark blond hair, Madoc dressed to impress. Girls flocked to him because he looked good in clothes, could talk the ears off an elephant, and loved to play. For all intents and purposes, he was a fun guy.</p><p>And he always made me feel small.</p><p>I talked a lot of shit, but truth be told, it was more for my ears than anyone else&#x2019;s. Madoc was designer. I was Target. He was Godiva. I was Snickers. And as far as he was concerned, he was entitled, and I was the freeloading daughter of the gold-digging whore who had snagged his father.</p><p>Madoc thought I was dirt under his shoe. Screw him.</p><p>I gave his outfit a condescending once-over. &#x201c;Your shirts&#x2014;which are super stylish, let me remind you. The gay community would be proud.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could get nice things, too. My dad pays your mom enough for her services, after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice things? Like the miniskirts you date?&#x201d; I challenged. Time to educate the little shit. &#x201c;Most guys, Madoc, like something different. You know why you want to see me in &#x2018;nice,&#x2019; skimpy things? Because the more I show, the less I&#x2019;m hiding. I scare you.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;Nada, little sister.&#x201d;</p><p>Little . . . I was only two months younger than him. He said shit like that to piss me off.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not your little sister.&#x201d; I took a step forward. &#x201c;And I do have friends. And plenty of guys interested. They like how I look. I don&#x2019;t subscribe to you and our snotty parents&#x2019; stand&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, I&#x2019;m bored,&#x201d; he cut me off with a sigh. &#x201c;Your life doesn&#x2019;t interest me, Fallon. Holiday dinners and once in a while around the house. Those are the only times I want to run in to you.&#x201d;</p><p>I tipped my chin up, trying not to give anything away. It didn&#x2019;t hurt. Not his words or his opinion of me. There was no ache in my throat that dropped down into my stomach and twisted the ever-present knots tighter. What he said didn&#x2019;t matter. I liked who I was. No one told me how to dress, how to behave, what clubs to join . . . I made my own decisions. Madoc was a puppet. A drone.</p><p>I&#x2019;m free.</p><p>When I said nothing, he started walking backward away from me. &#x201c;The parents are out for the night. I&#x2019;m having a party. Stay out of the way. Maybe hide out in the servants&#x2019; quarters where you belong.&#x201d;</p><p>I watched him go, knowing I wouldn&#x2019;t listen.</p><p>I would wish that I had.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p>MADOC</p><p>2 years later</p><p>&#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; I exclaimed. &#x201c;Could she move any slower?&#x201d; I asked Jared as I sat in the backseat of his girlfriend&#x2019;s G8 with my hands locked on top of my head.</p><p>Tate twisted around in the driver&#x2019;s seat, her eyes sharp like she wanted to drive a knife right through my skull. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m heading around a sharp turn at nearly fifty miles an hour on an unstable dirt road!&#x201d; she yelled. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t even a real race. It&#x2019;s practice. I told you that already!&#x201d; Every muscle in her face was tight as she chewed me out.</p><p>I dropped my head back and let out a sigh. Jared sat in front of me with his elbow on the door and his head in his hand.</p><p>It was Saturday afternoon, a week before Tate&#x2019;s first real race at our local, makeshift track&#x2014;the Loop&#x2014;and we&#x2019;d been on Route Five for the last three hours. Every time the little twerp downshifted too soon or didn&#x2019;t hit the gas fast enough, Jared kept quiet&#x2014;but not me.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t want to hurt his girlfriend&#x2019;s feelings, but I didn&#x2019;t care. Why tiptoe around her? I wasn&#x2019;t trying to get in her pants.</p><p>Not anymore, anyway.</p><p>Tate and Jared had spent most of high school hating each other. Battling with words and antics in the longest-running game of foreplay I&#x2019;d ever seen. Now they were all up in each other&#x2019;s shit like Romeo and Juliet. The porno version.</p><p>Jared turned his head but not enough to meet my eyes. &#x201c;Get out,&#x201d; he ordered.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I blurted, my eyes widening. &#x201c;But . . . but . . .&#x201d; I stuttered, catching sight of Tate&#x2019;s triumphant smile in the rearview mirror.</p><p>&#x201c;But nothing,&#x201d; Jared barked. &#x201c;Go get your car. She can race you.&#x201d;</p><p>The zing of adrenaline shot through me at the prospect of some real excitement. Tate could definitely race a chick who had no idea what she was doing, but she still had a lot to learn and some balls to grow.</p><p>Enter me. I wanted to smile, but I didn&#x2019;t. Instead, I just rolled my eyes. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;ll be boring.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re so funny,&#x201d; she mocked, gripping the steering wheel even tighter. &#x201c;You make a great twelve-year-old girl when you whine.&#x201d;</p><p>I opened the back door. &#x201c;Speaking of whining . . . want to make a bet on who&#x2019;ll be crying by the end of the day?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You will,&#x201d; she answered.</p><p>&#x201c;Not.&#x201d;</p><p>She grabbed a package of travel tissues and threw them at me. &#x201c;Here. Just in case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I see you keep a ready stock,&#x201d; I retorted. &#x201c;Because you cry so much, right?&#x201d;</p><p>She jerked around. &#x201c;Tais-toi! Je te d�tes&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I interrupted her. &#x201c;What was that? I&#x2019;m hot, and you love me? Jared, did you know she had feelings&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop it!&#x201d; he bellowed, shutting the both of us up. &#x201c;Goddamn it, you two.&#x201d; He threw his hands up in the air, looking between us like we were misbehaving children.</p><p>Tate and I were both silent for a moment. Then when she snorted, I couldn&#x2019;t help but let out a laugh, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Madoc?&#x201d; Jared&#x2019;s teeth were practically glued together. I could hear the tension in his voice. &#x201c;Out. Now.&#x201d;</p><p>I grabbed my cell off the seat and did as I was told, only because I knew my best friend had had enough.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been trying to bait Tate all day by making jokes and distracting Jared. She was finally racing a real opponent, and even though Jared and I had been working with her, we knew things went wrong out there on the track. All the time. But Tate insisted that she could handle it.</p><p>And what Tate wants, Tate gets. Jared was whipped worse than cream when it came to that girl.</p><p>I walked back down the track to the driveway leading in to it. My silver GTO sat along the side of the road, and I dug in my jeans for my keys with one hand while I ran the back of my hand across my forehead with the other.</p><p>It was early June, and everything was already so miserable. The heat wasn&#x2019;t bad, but the damn humidity made it worse. My mom had wanted me to come to New Orleans for the summer, and I gave her a big, fat hell-to-the-no.</p><p>Yeah, I love sweating my balls off while her new husband tries to teach me shrimping in the Gulf.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>I loved my mom, but the idea of having the house to myself all summer while my dad stayed at his apartment in Chicago was, no doubt, a much better prospect.</p><p>My hand tingled with a vibration, and I looked down at my phone.</p><p>Speak of the devil.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, what&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I asked my dad as I came up on the side of my car.</p><p>&#x201c;Madoc. Glad you answered. Are you home?&#x201d; He sounded unusually concerned.</p><p>&#x201c;No. I was about to head there soon, though. Why?&#x201d;</p><p>My dad was hardly ever around. He kept an apartment in Chicago. since his big legal cases kept him working long hours. While often absent, he was easy to get along with.</p><p>I liked him. Didn&#x2019;t love him, though.</p><p>My stepmom had been AWOL for a year. Traveling, visiting friends. I hated her.</p><p>And I had a stepsister . . . somewhere.</p><p>The only person I loved at home was Addie, our housekeeper. She made sure I ate my vegetables, and she signed my permission slips for school. She was my family.</p><p>&#x201c;Addie called this morning,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Fallon showed up today.&#x201d; My breath lodged in my throat, and I nearly dropped my phone.</p><p>Fallon?</p><p>Putting my palm down on the hood of my car, I put my head down and tried to stop grinding my teeth.</p><p>My stepsister was home. Why? Why now?</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; I spat out. &#x201c;What does that have to do with me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Addie packed you a bag.&#x201d; He ignored my question. &#x201c;I talked to Jared&#x2019;s mom, and you&#x2019;re going to stay with them for a few weeks until my schedule frees up. I&#x2019;ll come home then and get this sorted out.&#x201d;</p><p>Excuse me? It felt like the phone would crack under my fingers as I clenched it.</p><p>&#x201c;What? Why?&#x201d; I yelled, breathing hard. &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t I stay at my own house?&#x201d;</p><p>Since when did she get the run of things? So she was home. Big deal! Send her on her way then. Why did I have to be sent away?</p><p>&#x201c;You know why,&#x201d; my dad answered, his deep tone threatening. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go home, Madoc.&#x201d;</p><p>And he hung up.</p><p>I stayed planted where I stood, studying the reflection of the trees on the hood of my car.

It is a crossing of two boulevards for dreamers in the South, white and black. On the one hand, there are the gleaming sky scrapers of Peachtree, the street where Gone With the Wind author Margaret Mitchell once lived and later met her tragic death; and on the other, there are the Reconstruction-era churches of Auburn Avenue, where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once preached and where his bier is now entombed inside a crypt with the epitaph "Free at Last, Free at Last, Thank God Almighty I'm Free at Last." The contrast between these streets hearkens to a time when boundaries were imposed by law, by segregation; this roughing of borders provides lingering evidence of a history and a city only recently joined. Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn explores the social, political and spiritual growth of this city and defines its racial conscience. It is the biography of Atlanta as told through two of its most prominent and elite families - one white, one black - as they ascend over five generations on opposite sides of a segregated city to produce the two most controversial mayors of the New South: Ivan Allen, Jr., and Maynard Jackson.<br>This is a story about family, race relations and the evolving South. Gary M. Pomerantz explores Atlanta's transformation - from its founding as the railroad center Terminus in 1837 to the ashes left by Gen. William T. Sherman's Union troops in 1864 to its role as center of the civil rights movement during the 1960s to its selection as the site of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Atlanta's history represents one of the most stark, dramatic examples of racial interdependence of any American city. The Allens and the Dobbses, two Southern families who have lived in Atlanta for nearly a century, offer a vehicle to understand the rise of Atlanta as the definitive symbol of the New South. Both families contributed to this great work, providing hours of interviews during the past five years and aiding the research with exclusive letters, journals and photographs that date to the Civil War, when the Allens were aristocratic slave-holding members of the Confederacy in east Tennessee and the Dobbses were slaves in north Georgia. Their worlds were shattered by the Civil War and their families' fortunes took flight at the turn of the century when patriarchs Ivan Allen, Sr., and John Wesley Dobbs arrived in a bustling, rebuilt Atlanta.</p><p>In Atlanta, a city hyped during the 1996 Olympics as the South&#39;s most progressive city, Peachtree Street is the main commercial avenue of white business power; Auburn Street, known as Sweet Auburn, is the old center of the city&#39;s black community. Their intersection is rather insignificant, a fact mirrored in the racial segregation that has always characterized Atlantan society. Pomerantz has traced the history of the city, and the development of race relations from the city&#39;s founding to the present day, through the experiences of two emblematic and influential families: that of Ivan Allen Jr., a white mayor in the 60&#39;s; and that of Maynard H. Jackson, the city&#39;s first black mayor. The result is a vividly humanized and objective history.Gary M.

Yet <i>Pale Fire</i> is more outrageously hilarious, and its narrative convolutions make the earlier book seem as straightforward as a fairy tale. Here's the plot--listen carefully! John Shade is a homebody poet in New Wye, U.S.A. He writes a 999-line poem about his life, and what may lie beyond death. This novel (and seldom has the word seemed so woefully inadequate) consists of both that poem and an extensive commentary on it by the poet's crazy neighbor, Charles Kinbote.<p> According to this deranged annotator, he had urged Shade to write about his own homeland--the northern kingdom of Zembla. It soon becomes clear that this fabulous locale may well be a figment of Kinbote's colorfully cracked, prismatic imagination. Meanwhile, he manages to twist the poem into an account of Zembla's King Charles--whom he believes himself to <i>be</i>--and the monarch's eventual assassination by the revolutionary Jakob Gradus.</p><p> In the course of this dizzying narrative, shots are indeed fired. But it's Shade who takes the hit, enabling Kinbote to steal the dead poet's manuscript and set about annotating it. Is that perfectly clear? By now it should be obvious that <i>Pale Fire</i> is not only a whodunit but a who-wrote-it. There isn't, of course, a single solution. But Nabokov's best biographer, Brian Boyd, has come up with an ingenious suggestion: he argues that Shade is actually guiding Kinbote's mad hand from beyond the grave, nudging him into completing what he'd intended to be a 1,000-line poem. Read this magical, melancholic mystery and see if you agree. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Pale Fire Nabokov offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures: a 999-line poem by the reclusive genius John Shade; an adoring foreword and commentary by Shade&#39;s self-styled Boswell, Dr. Charles Kinbote; a darkly comic novel of suspense, literary idolatry and one-upmanship, and political intrigue.</p><h2>Screech Owl at Midnight Hollow - a Smithsonian&#39;s Backyard Book (Smithsonian Backyard)</h2><p>Children will follow Screech Owl as he hunts and feeds his five little nestlings.

There were several very good reasons behind an infatuation that had lasted for most of her first year at St Scholastika&#x2019;s College. Corinna, the college&#x2019;s junior philosophy fellow, was the smartest woman she&#x2019;d ever met. She was also the least stuffy academic, the most challenging conversationalist and the most demanding teacher Charlie had encountered. She was charmed by Corinna&#x2019;s Canadian accent, in awe of her mind and attracted by her sardonic smile. The husband, four children and adamantine Catholicism were mere details that barely impinged on Charlie&#x2019;s dreamy fantasies. And she never noticed that, like the family, she was entirely under Corinna&#x2019;s thumb.<br>And now she was going to have to pluck up the courage to call her. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been such a trial six months before, when Charlie had still been someone with a decent professional reputation, albeit tinged with a degree of notoriety. But now? Charlie stared at the phone and sighed.<br> Oh, bugger,&#x201d; Charlie muttered, reaching for the handset. This time of day, Corinna should still be in college.<br> St Scholastika&#x2019;s College. How may I help you?&#x201d; The burr of a local accent that sounded as if it had escaped from a BBC costume drama.<br> I&#x2019;d like to speak to Dr. Newsam,&#x201d; Charlie said, more brusque than she&#x2019;d intended.<br> May I ask who&#x2019;s calling?&#x201d;<br> Dr. Charlotte Flint.&#x201d;<br> Dr. Flint? How nice to hear you. One moment, I&#x2019;ll see if Dr. Newsam&#x2019;s available.&#x201d;<br>Bloody Oxford. Never lets you go. Charlie waited, hollow silence in her ear. Nothing as tacky as canned muzak for her alma mater. She&#x2019;d almost given up when she heard a sharp click followed by a familiar drawl. Charlie? Is that really you?&#x201d;<br> Corinna,&#x201d; she said, taken aback by the warmth she suddenly felt. But you&#x2019;re not really surprised, are you?&#x201d;<br> That depends on why you&#x2019;re calling.&#x201d;<br>The joust was on. Charlie felt tired at the thought of it. She moved in a different world these days, and she preferred it. I&#x2019;m calling because you sent me a package of newspaper clippings,&#x201d; she said. About the trial of the two people who allegedly murdered Magda&#x2019;s husband on their wedding day.&#x201d;<br> Why would I do that?&#x201d; Corinna sounded as if this were no more important than a routine tutorial inquiry about some detail of an essay.<br> I think it was a challenge, Corinna. Given what you sent, would I be able to figure out who had sent it? And why? You did it because you&#x2019;re a philosopher. You&#x2019;ve grown so accustomed to setting everyone tests and challenges that you&#x2019;ve forgotten how to ask a straight question.&#x201d;<br> And what could my motivation for such a challenge possibly be?&#x201d; Charlie thought she could hear tension in Corinna&#x2019;s voice now, but she couldn&#x2019;t swear to it.<br> I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; she said. But I did track down one photograph that gave me pause. I think if I was a mother and my daughter was running around with Jay Macallan Stewart, I&#x2019;d be shouting for the cavalry. Now, I know I&#x2019;m not everybody&#x2019;s idea of the cavalry, but I&#x2019;m probably all you could think of at short notice.&#x201d;<br>There was no humour in Corinna&#x2019;s laugh. I thought my memory was still reliable. You always had a gift for investigation and resolution. It&#x2019;s good to see the years have only sharpened it. Well done, Charlie.&#x201d;<br> What&#x2019;s all this about, Corinna? Apart from me being your self-fulfilling prophecy?&#x201d;<br> I need your help.&#x201d;<br>Charlie sighed. It&#x2019;s seventeen years since I graduated, Corinna. You don&#x2019;t know anything about me.&#x201d;<br> I know enough, Charlie. I feel pretty certain you&#x2019;ve got a burning desire to redeem yourself right now.&#x201d;<br>Charlie closed her eyes and massaged her forehead. That&#x2019;s a little presumptuous, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br>A moment&#x2019;s silence, then Corinna spoke crisply. We know you here, Charlie. And there is a strong feeling among the senior members in college that you have been made a scapegoat. That you have in fact acted with honour and honesty. It may have been uncomfortable, but it was right to stand up for Bill Hopton&#x2019;s innocence when he was actually innocent. It&#x2019;s not your fault he went on his killing spree afterwards.&#x201d;<br> Some might disagree with you,&#x201d; Charlie said, her voice weary. Some might say it was his very experiences at the hands of those of us involved in law enforcement that sent him over the edge.&#x201d;<br> Speaking as a philosopher, I find that an untenable proposition,&#x201d; Corinna said briskly. Now, there&#x2019;s nothing we can do to help you professionally, obviously. Although I&#x2019;m sure, where influence exists, it&#x2019;s being brought to bear. But what I can do is offer you the chance to be useful. To use your skills for good, if you like.&#x201d;<br>Charlie didn&#x2019;t know why, but she felt like laying her head on the desk and weeping. I don&#x2019;t have the faintest idea what you&#x2019;re on about, Corinna. And I&#x2019;m pretty sure I don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d;<br> Charlie, we can help each other here. But a phone call isn&#x2019;t the way to do this. Come and talk to me. Come to Oxford for the weekend.&#x201d;<br> I don&#x2019;t think so, Corinna.&#x201d;<br> All I&#x2019;m asking is that you listen to me, Charlie. I understand the reason you do what you do. It&#x2019;s because you have a desire to protect the vulnerable. Right now, Charlie, my daughter has never been more vulnerable. Can your conscience really afford any more burdens?&#x201d;<br> That&#x2019;s a very poor effort at emotional blackmail, Corinna.&#x201d;<br> You said yourself if you had a daughter who was running around with Jay Macallan Stewart, you&#x2019;d be shouting for help. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m doing here.&#x201d;<br> I understand that. But I&#x2019;m not the person to help with this. I don&#x2019;t know how to break up Magda and Jay Stewart.&#x201d;<br> I&#x2019;m not asking you to separate my daughter from Jay Macallan Stewart,&#x201d; Corinna said, sounding ruffled for the first time. I wouldn&#x2019;t be so crass. What I&#x2019;m asking is that you bring your talents to bear on uncovering that truth. At heart, this is about a miscarriage of justice. I thought you still cared about that kind of thing, Charlie.&#x201d;<br>It doesn&#x2019;t take long for silence on a phone to loom large. After a few empty seconds, Charlie said, I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br> Paul Barker and Joanna Sanderson did not kill my son-in-law, Charlie. The jury&#x2019;s out today, the evidence is stacked against them. They&#x2019;re going to jail. And it&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d;<br> Haven&#x2019;t you left it a bit late to try and drag me into this? If it was really about avoiding a miscarriage of justice, surely you should have called me weeks ago.&#x201d;<br>Corinna&#x2019;s exasperated sigh was not unfamiliar to Charlie. This hasn&#x2019;t exactly been easy for me. I thought it would be thrown out of court. I had no idea how far . . . Look, Charlie, what matters here is that the two people in the dock are innocent. They didn&#x2019;t kill Philip.&#x201d;<br>Charlie couldn&#x2019;t help herself. Who did?&#x201d;<br> Some things don&#x2019;t work over the phone. Come and talk to me, Charlie.&#x201d;<br>Hook, line and sinker, Charlie thought.

Lee&#39;s closest companion and devoted horse, Traveller.</p><p>The Civil War has been viewed from almost every possible perspective, but Adams breaks new ground: a first-person narrative, in dialect, by Robert E. Lee's horse. Traveller's equine memoirs are told to a cat in the stable of the retired general. There is a twist to this central event in American history: Traveller is unaware that Lee lost. Although Adams's five previous novels were well received, the mythic clarity and enchantment of Watership Down or Shardik are missing here. Still, interest in the previous novels should create demand. BOMC alternate. Edwin B. Burgess, U.S. Army TRALINET Ctr., Fort Monroe, Va.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.The author of Watership Down devises an ironic, revisionist view of the Civil War as seen by Robert E. Lee's horse, Traveller. "Fans of Adams's earlier novels will rejoice in his undiminished gift for conveying both the physical life and the interior essence of an animal . . . . But the author's depiction of human action is less convincing, with repetitious, meandering delineations of encampments, advances and attacks," said PW. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How to Let God Help You</h2><p>How to Let God Help You is a spiritual classic that speaks to today's readers.

This generously illustrated book offers readers the chance to appreciate the full range of works by Marisa Merz, winner of the 2013 Golden Lion lifetime achievement award at the Venice Biennale. This volume traces Merz&#x2019;s artistic evolution from early experiments with non-traditional materials and processes, to intricately constructed installations of the 1970s and the enigmatic ceramic heads of the 1980s and &#x2019;90s. Authoritative essays explore the rise of international women&#x2019;s art in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s and Merz&#x2019;s own place in Italy&#x2019;s postwar art history. As the sole female protagonist of Arte Povera she is one of the few Italian women to exhibit in major venues internationally. Merz&#x2019;s challenging and evocative body of work is deeply personal and resistant to the categories of art history, including Arte Povera and international feminist art, with which she was associated. Previously unpublished texts and poetry by the artist, and an illustrated chronology, complement this comprehensive look at an enormously influential artist.</p><p>Connie Butler is Chief Curator at the Hammer Museum."Merz refuses to call herself or her art feminist, to the extent that she banished the word from the title of one of several fine essays in the Met Breuer show&#x2019;s catalogue. I&#x2019;m reminded of some strong-willed women artists I knew, in the early years of the women&#x2019;s movement, who also resisted having their solitary struggles described in ideological terms.

One by one, ten monsters join the chaotic going-ons in a little boy's house. Once they all arrive, the little boy is faced with "Ten hungry monsters,/ about to fuss and kick,/ won't get out, they tell me,/ unless I feed them quick!" And so he does. He brings out ". . .1 jug of apple juice,/ 2 loaves of bread . . ," until the monsters have spaghetti, eggplant, pears, pumpkins, turkeys, pizza pies, watermelons, and jars of peanut butter. But even then the monsters are not content, and they create havoc in the house until the boy insists that they leave. While he enjoys the muffin he had hidden, a monster peeks out of the fireplace--a detail that won't go unnoticed by young readers. Munsinger's illustrations of the monsters are better than those of the boy; they're a delight. Not too scary, they're just ugly enough to fit the part. The details make the illustrations overflow with humor.

In time, the shy Rabbit befriends the tattered Skin Horse, the wisest resident of the nursery, who reveals the goal of all nursery toys: to be made "real" through the love of a human. "'Real isn't how you are made,' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you.

Richard J. Blackwell offers a fresh approach to the Galileo case, using as his primary focus the biblical and ecclesiastical issues that were the battleground for the celebrated confrontation. Blackwell's research in the Vatican manuscript collection and the Jesuit archives in Rome enables him to re-create a vivid picture of the trends and counter-trends that influenced leading Catholic thinkers of the period: the conservative reaction to the Reformation, the role of authority in biblical exegesis and in guarding orthodoxy from the inroads of "unbridled spirits," and the position taken by Cardinal Bellarmine and the Jesuits in attempting to weigh the discoveries of the new science in the context of traditional philosophy and theology. A centerpiece of Blackwell's investigation is his careful reading of the brief treatise <i>Letter on the Motion of the Earth</i> by Paolo Antonio Foscarini, a Carmelite scholar, arguing for the compatibility of the Copernican system with the Bible. Blackwell appends the first modern translation into English of this important and neglected document, which was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1616. Though there were differing and competing theories of biblical interpretation advocated in Galileo's time&#x2015;the legacy of the Council of Trent, the views of Cardinal Bellarmine, the most influential churchman of his time, and, finally, the claims of authority and obedience that weakened the abillity of Jesuit scientists to support the new science&#x2015;all contributed to the eventual condemnation of Galileo in 1633. Blackwell argues convincingly that the maintenance of ecclesiastical authority, not the scientific issues themselves, led to that tragic trial.</p><p>Richard J.

However, some broke from these taboos and took up the previously male privilege of travelling to the Continent to develop mind, spirit and body. Hearing of the delights of the Grand Tour from pioneering friends, increasing numbers of English ladies set off to sample foreign lands from which many returned apparently &#39;the best informed and most perfect creatures&#39;. For others the Grand Tour was an intellectual and romantic rite of passage, widening their knowledge of society, love and politics and inspiring a genre of literary fiction all of its own. Brian Dolan leads us into the hearts and minds of the ladies through the stories, thoughts and court gossip recorded in their journals, letters and diaries.</p><p>Brian Dolan is a young American historian who received his doctorate from Cambridge University in 1995.

While the 442nd and the 100th Battalion were covering themselves with glory in Italy, other Japanese Americans had already stood to arms in defense of Pearl Harbor and volunteered by the hundreds and thousands as indispensable translators for military intelligence in the Pacific theater. Some of those intelligence operatives worked in occupied areas; others risked and sometimes lost their lives trying to persuade Japanese soldiers to surrender. Crost's effort greatly increases knowledge of this aspect of Asian American history, even as it also increases outrage at the panic, bigotry, and outright criminality behind the placing of Japanese Americans on the home front in internment camps. <i>Roland Green</i>In the European theater of WWII, the Japanese Americans making up the 442nd Regimental Combat Team were so dependably fierce that, according to General Alfred Greunther, every division in the Fifth Army "insisted that the 442nd be assigned to it." The Nisei (second-generation) soldiers also distinguished themselves in the Pacific. As Crost reveals, their life away from the battlefield was hazardous as well: non-Asian GIs in Europe scorned them as turncoats, while in the Pacific they were in constant danger of being mistaken by Marines for the enemy. While these Japanese Americans were defending the country of their birth, their families languished in concentration camps in the U.S., marked as "enemy aliens" after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Crost, who covered the Nisei soldiers throughout the war for the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, offers a stirring but saddening account.

We&#x2019;d been away so long, first in swampy country, then in a big city&#x2014;maybe called Foggy Bottom&#x2014;that confused me from the get-go. Is there time to mention the air in both those places before we really get started? Soggy and heavy: that sums it up.<br> <br>Where were we? Was it possibly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. home? Yes! Home! Home at last! Our home&#x2014;mine and Bernie&#x2019;s&#x2014;is on Mesquite Road. Mesquite Road&#x2019;s in the Valley. Quite recently I might have heard that the Valley&#x2019;s in Arizona, but don&#x2019;t count on that. What matters is that right now I was inhaling a nice big noseful of Valley air. Light and dry, with a hint of greasewood and just plain grease: perfect. I felt tip-top. Bernie opened our door, kicked aside a huge pile of mail, and we went in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Bernie, dropping our duffel bag on the floor. I did the first thing that came to mind&#x2014;just about always my MO&#x2014;which in this case meant sniffing my way from room to room, zigzagging back and forth, nose to the floor. Front hall, our bedroom, Charlie&#x2019;s bedroom&#x2014;mattress bare on account of Charlie not being around much since the divorce&#x2014;office, with the circus-elephant-pattern rug, where I actually picked up a faint whiff of elephant, even though no elephant had ever been in the office. I&#x2019;d had some experience with elephants, specifically an elephant name of Peanut, no time to go into that now. The point was: somehow I was smelling elephants in the office. Had to mean I was on a roll. Chet the Jet!<br> <br>Sniff sniff sniffing gets your nostrils quivering real fast, a nice feeling, as you might not know, the human sense of smell&#x2014;even in huge-nosed dudes and gals&#x2014;always turning out to be shockingly weak, in my experience. Take Bernie, for example, and his lovely big nose, somewhat crooked, although he plans to get it fixed when he&#x2019;s sure no more dustups are in his future, which I hope is never, on account of how satisfying it is to see that sweet uppercut of his, followed by some perp toppling limp to the floor, all set for me to grab him by the pant leg, meaning case closed, closing cases being what we do at the Little Detective Agency. Little on account of Bernie&#x2019;s last name being Little. I&#x2019;m Chet, pure and simple. As for Bernie&#x2019;s big crooked nose: What&#x2019;s it for? Just beauty? Is that enough? I tried to think about that, got as far as: Why not? Hey! Beauty was enough! And of course Bernie&#x2019;s the most beautiful human I&#x2019;ve ever seen. Hold on to that fact, if nothing else.<br> <br>I sniffed my way over toward the wall where we&#x2019;ve got our safe, hidden behind a framed picture of a waterfall. We&#x2019;ve got lots of waterfall pictures, water being one of Bernie&#x2019;s biggest worries. Why worry, you might think, when we had bright green golf courses out the yingyang here in the Valley, sprinklers on full blast morning and night, making beautiful rainbows? A lovely sight, but not to Bernie. What was the aquifer, again? Maybe Bernie and I should go find it, put things right. Wow! One of my best ideas ever! The next thing I knew I was flat on my back, wriggling around on the elephant-patterned rug to my heart&#x2019;s content. After a while I thought: Why? Why am I doing this? I tried to remember, came up blank, stopped wriggling, and in that blank and motionless pause, I caught another unexpected smell, this time not of elephants but of Iggy.<br> <br>Iggy? Iggy&#x2019;s my best pal, lives next door with the Parsons. The fun we used to have! But that was before the Parsons&#x2014;a real old couple&#x2014;bought an electric fence that they never managed to work right, so now Iggy didn&#x2019;t get out much. And even in the old days, had he ever been in our house? Not that I remembered. So what was his smell doing here, not a faint, long-ago kind of smell by the way, but strong and recent?<br> <br>I rolled over, popped up on my feet, barked one of my barks, of which I&#x2019;ve got many, one or two that can tear the roof off, as Bernie says. The truth is he only said it once, but it led to a whole night of me trying to bark the roof off where we were, which happened to be a hotel&#x2014;possibly the Ritz&#x2014;where we&#x2019;d gone for a special weekend with Suzie, Suzie being Bernie&#x2019;s girlfriend, a crack reporter now working for the Washington Post&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which might be in Foggy Bottom! I came real close to figuring out something about the past. But no cigar, which didn&#x2019;t bother me at all. Once I chewed on a cigar butt, and believe me it&#x2019;s not something you&#x2019;d want to repeat. Although I did. And then again.<br> <br>Back to this particular bark. Not close to my loudest, but sharp and quickly cut off, sending a message. I was about to try it again, even sharper, when Bernie stuck his head in the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;You okay, big guy?&#x201d;<br> <br>There he was! My Bernie. Hadn&#x2019;t seen him in way too long. My tail started wagging, closed in on blur speed. The room got breezy, not sure why, but that breeze carried Iggy&#x2019;s scent. My tail hit the brakes in mid-wag, stood tall and stiff, and I was back to barking that sharp bark, eyes on Bernie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Going through some mood changes, huh?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Which I didn&#x2019;t get at all. I was about to bark one more time&#x2014;Bernie! We&#x2019;ve got a problem!&#x2014;when he took a gun from his pocket and moved toward the waterfall picture. We&#x2019;d had several guns in our career&#x2014;including the .38 Special, now at the bottom of the sea for reasons I couldn&#x2019;t remember even if I tried, which I did not&#x2014;and for a while quite recently we&#x2019;d been completely gunless, not good in our line of work, but that .45&#x2014;a big stopper&#x2014;in Bernie&#x2019;s hand meant we were good to go again. A big stopper, by the way, that I&#x2019;d taken off a perp or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or possibly a cop of some sort? I was wondering about wondering about that, as Bernie reached for the waterfall painting. A gun not in use belonged in the safe, where we also kept some papers, plus our most valuable possession, Bernie&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s watch.<br> <br>Bernie removed the painting, spun the dial on the safe, put the gun&#x2014;but no. What was this? No safe? No safe behind the waterfall painting, but instead just a hole in the wall? Bernie went still. So did I. We&#x2019;re a lot alike in some ways, although the only one actually panting was me.<br> <br>Bernie lowered the painting, leaned it against the wall. He put the gun back in his pocket, all his movements real slow now, his gaze on the hole in our office wall. I could feel his thoughts. He was thinking his hardest. When Bernie thinks his hardest, the air feels like a storm&#x2019;s coming on. Then he gets an idea and you feel light as a balloon when someone lets go of the string. Feeling light as a balloon when someone lets go of the string&#x2014;Charlie, for example&#x2014;is the best. I waited as patiently as I could for Bernie to get an idea. All I knew was that Iggy couldn&#x2019;t be the perp. He&#x2019;s way too small, for one thing, and not much of a leaper. Leaping is my best thing, although I&#x2019;d somehow flunked the leaping test at K-9 School on my very last day. Was a cat involved? And maybe some blood? It didn&#x2019;t matter. That was how I&#x2019;d met Bernie, meaning it was the best day of my life, except for all those that followed. But I still wouldn&#x2019;t mind a do-over on the leaping test.<br> <br>Bernie went to the desk, checked all the drawers. Then he walked slowly around the room, eyeing everything real careful, the way he does when we&#x2019;re on a case. Was this a case? If so, who was paying? The Little Detective Agency is the best in town, not counting the finances part. We&#x2019;d had some bumps in the road when it comes to finances. Don&#x2019;t get me started on Hawaiian pants or tin futures in Bolivia. In fact, I&#x2019;m never mentioning them again.<br> <br>We left the office and went through the whole house, starting with the front door&#x2014;not a mark on it&#x2014;and going all the way to the back door, off the kitchen. No marks on the back door, either. Bernie opened it, worked the lock a few times.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we dealing with a pro?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I had no idea, wasn&#x2019;t sure I understood the question. We walked out onto the back patio. The swan fountain&#x2014;pretty much all Leda had left behind after the divorce&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t running. Bernie reached for the faucet on the side wall and was just about to start the water flowing out of the swan&#x2019;s stone mouth, when he noticed something shiny on the tiles of the empty pool bottom. He picked it up, and held it so we could both have a good look. A small but thick silver snakehead on a broken chain?<br> <br>&#x201c;Pendant,&#x201d; Bernie said. He took a closer look at the edge of the pool, bent over, and pointed to a reddish patch on a blue tile, although I can&#x2019;t be trusted when it comes to red, according to Bernie, so skip this part. &#x201c;See what happened here? Dude doesn&#x2019;t see the fountain&#x2014;meaning nighttime and maybe not a pro after all&#x2014;falls in, scrapes off some skin, loses the pendant. On the way out or the way in? I&#x2019;m thinking the way in. On the way out he&#x2019;d have the safe, and a dropped safe leaves marks. So, not a pro, plus no sign of forced entry.&#x201d; Bernie rose. &#x201c;Meaning he had a key.&#x201d; He gazed at the silver snakehead&#x2014;who would want that around his neck?&#x2014;and the heavy broken chain lying on his palm. &#x201c;Yeah. He for sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>&#x201c;Leda?&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br> <br>We were back in the kitchen. Leda came over the speaker. &#x201c;I recognize the voice,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, right. It hasn&#x2019;t changed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry? Not quite following you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My point exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in a good mood.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;The thing is, we&#x2019;re back,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know that. You texted me an hour ago. I&#x2019;ll bring Charlie over Saturday morning, as agreed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. Good. Thanks. But that&#x2019;s not why I called.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was wondering if you still had a key to the place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Another one, you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sound a little slow today, Bernie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie&#x2019;s voice got a bit edgy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just trying to find out about the key.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leda&#x2019;s voice got even edgier. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not in the mood for one of your blamefests. I humbly apologize for my indiscretion, but I had no idea I even still had a key until last week. I was sending some things over for the homeless, and the stupid thing fell out of an old Gucci bag. I drove by to drop it off with Mr. Parsons. That&#x2019;s the only key I had. Unknowingly, as I&#x2019;m trying to make clear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Parsons? One&#x2014;he was outside. Two&#x2014;I&#x2019;d tried your slot, but it was blocked by the mountain of mail in the hall. Three&#x2014;if you don&#x2019;t trust Mr. Parsons, you&#x2019;ve got paranoia issues.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, okay, I was just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Click.<br> <br>Bernie looked at me. I looked at him. &#x201c;Started well but cratered fast,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Where do I go wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie going wrong? That made no sense to me. I pressed my head against his leg, pressed my very hardest. It was all I could think of to do. Bernie recovered his balance in a flash. He&#x2019;s quick on his feet, just another wonderful thing about him.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>We went over to the Parsonses&#x2019; house. &#x201c;Wow!&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;This is new.&#x201d; A big saguaro stood in the Parsonses&#x2019; front yard, freshly dug earth piled around the base. I&#x2019;m not a fan of saguaros, especially the kind that look like giant green men, such as this one. I laid my mark on it in my quickest and most efficient manner, and we walked to the front door.<br> <br>Bernie knocked. Right away I heard Iggy start up on the other side. How I&#x2019;d missed that amazingly high-pitched yip-yip-yip yip-yip-yip, a yip-yip-yipping Iggy could sustain all night if he wanted, and he often did! But now it was saying Welcome home, buddy! Let&#x2019;s do something fun! Like dig up old man Heydrich&#x2019;s lawn, old man Heydrich being our neighbor on the other side. Dig it up so it stayed that way! What a brilliant idea, especially coming from Iggy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chet! What do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>Uh-oh. Possibly standing on my back legs, pawing at the door? Maybe more like clawing into it, somewhat deeply? If that was really happening, I got it under control and pronto. If you&#x2019;d looked, you&#x2019;d have seen me standing silent and still beside Bernie, like a good citizen, whatever that happened to be. You&#x2019;d have thought I&#x2019;d been like that the whole time. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and hadn&#x2019;t I? Hey! You&#x2019;d have been right! And me, too! Which made me like you! What a day I was having, and it had hardly begun! It was great to be home.<br> <br>Stump stump stump. That was the sound of Mr. Parsons on his walker, stumping toward the door. Stumping mixed with yipping in a way I found quite pleasant. Then came some grunting, the grunting of an old dude bending down to do something, and after that the door opened. Not much, but enough for Iggy to shoot through. Iggy! My best pal. We bounced off each other, Iggy spinning high in the air, and took off for parts unknown&#x2014;my favorite kind of parts!&#x2014;ears flat back from the wind we were making with our own speed, knocking over this and that, chasing every living&#x2014;But no. None of that happened, except Iggy shooting through and bouncing off me. Why? Because Iggy was on a leash. A leash in the house? I&#x2019;d never heard of such a thing. And even so, it almost didn&#x2019;t matter because the leash slipped from old Mr. Parsons&#x2019;s hand. But Bernie grabbed it, and Iggy came to a sudden halt, hanging in midair for what seemed like the longest time, before thumping back down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, sorry to bother you, Daniel,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No bother,&#x201d; said Mr. Parsons. &#x201c;Nice to see you back. Read a rather hair-raising account of your recent adventures in the Sunday paper.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know how they exaggerate,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t amount to much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice to see you anyhow.&#x201d;<br> <br>And it was nice to see old Mr. Parsons. Was he getting skinnier? His shirt, buttoned to the neck, hung kind of loose on him. So did his long pants. His feet were bare, nice broad feet I&#x2019;d always liked. I was considering giving them a quick lick when he said, &#x201c;Anything I can do for you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Bernie said, getting a tighter grip on the leash, Iggy&#x2019;s stubby legs now churning at top speed, although he was going nowhere, &#x201c;I was hoping to pick up the key Leda left with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure thing,&#x201d; Mr. Parsons said. &#x201c;Come on in.&#x201d;<br> <br>We entered the Parsonses&#x2019; front hall, me first, after a little confusion in the doorway. Bernie tugged Iggy in after him and closed the door. Meanwhile, Mr. Parsons went to a small corner desk and opened the front drawer.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s funny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know I put it here.&#x201d;</p><h2>On Wilderness Trails</h2><p>A book of photographs and drawings of the Canadian outdoors by well-known Christian author W.

Little did Humphrey Bogart know when he uttered the final line - &#34;This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship&#34; - that he had just closed what would be one of the most enduring and popular movies ever. Aljean Harmetz believes that &#34;every movie is a creature built from accidents and blind choices - a mechanical monster constructed of camera angles, the chemistry between actors, too little money or too much and a thousand unintended moments&#34;. Her portrait of the making of an unmatched classic reveals some of the accidents: how the stars of the movie almost weren&#39;t Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman; how &#34;As Time Goes By&#34; nearly didn&#39;t make it to the final cut.</p><p>Harmetz conjures up the film world of 1942 in this spirited and knowledgeable look at the production of Casablanca .

There, in 1887, Lady Francesca Speranza Wilde, Oscar Wilde's mother and a well-known author in her own right, compiled this collection of charming, authentic folk tales. Collected from among the peasantry and retaining their original simplicity, the myths and legends reveal delightfully the Irish people's relationship with a spiritual and invisible world populated by fairies, elves, and evil beings.

He was the Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University.Nozick here offers an illuminating discussion of such topics as death, sexuality, and friendship--concerns that everyone has but that have not often been discussed by analytic philosophers, among whom Nozick holds eminent rank. His consideration of broader questions--e.g., what is the nature of value?--leads him to extend the theory of value he developed in Philosophical Explanations ( LJ 11/1/81), and he unifies a wide range of phenomena that previous philosophers have been unable to connect as tightly. He also addresses theological concerns, throwing unexpected light on such topics as the nature of God and the problem of evil. Chapter 25, "The Zig-Zag of Politics," will without doubt rivet political philosophers, for here Nozick recants in part the libertarianism he supported in Anarchy, State, and Utopia ( LJ 1/15/75). This strikingly original book will arouse much discussion.

Their intense mutual hatred was both ideologically driven and deeply personal. Their vitriolic duels, carried out over decades, lend profound insight into the social and political currents that dominated Victorian England. To Disraeli&#x2015;a legendary dandy descended from Sephardic Jews&#x2015;his antagonist was an "unprincipled maniac" characterized by an "extraordinary mixture of envy, vindictiveness, hypocrisy, and superstition." For the conservative aristocrat Gladstone, his rival was "the Grand Corrupter," whose destruction he plotted "day and night, week by week, month by month." In the tradition of Roy Jenkins and A. N. Wilson, Richard Aldous has written an outstanding political biography, giving us the first dual portrait of this intense and momentous rivalry. Aldous's vivid narrative style&#x2015;by turns powerful, witty, and stirring&#x2015;brings new life to the Gladstone and Disraeli story and confirms a perennial truth: in politics, everything is personal. 16 pages of illustrations</p><p>Richard Aldous is a professor of history at Bard College, where he holds the Eugene Meyer Chair. He is the author and editor of eleven books and is a contributor to television and radio on both sides of the Atlantic. Aldous&#x2019;s writing appears regularly in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times Book Review, and The American Interest, where he is a contributing editor. He lives in Red Hook, New York.Two titans, Disraeli and Gladstone, dominated English politics in the Victorian age. Each did multiple stints as prime minister and as leader of the Conservative (Disraeli) or Liberal (Gladstone) party. Political opposition shifted over the years to mutual personal disapproval and finally to rage-driven attack. Aldous (of University College, Dublin) traces the development of this seemingly pathological antagonism amid the policy disputes of the era. Both combatants displayed rhetorical skills unimaginable in a politician today. Both were writers, Gladstone of dull works on religion and on Homer, Disraeli of novels lampooning notable figures of his day, especially Gladstone. Aldous portrays both as possessing repellent character traits, such as Disraeli's vindictive mockery and Gladstone's moral hypocrisy. All these tangy ingredients make this joint biography highly appetizing, even if some readers may find issues like the Corn Laws, that so energized Gladstone and Disraeli, a bit faded. However, vexing issues of international trade, religion in public life and voting rights divide our nation as they did Victorian England. Aldous's smooth pacing and adroit writing bring a forgotten world back to life and demonstrate how two forceful if warring personalities can create a history that neither could have achieved acting alone. <i>(Sept.) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There in the depths is a mysterious and beautiful creature with a sharp tongue and a broken heart: a mermaid named Aquamarine who has left her six sisters to search for love on land. Now, as this mythological yet very real being starts to fade in the burning August sun, a rescue is begun.<br> On the edge of growing up, during a summer that is the hottest on record, Hailey and Claire are discovering that life can take an unpredictable course, friendship is forever, and magic can be found in the most unexpected places.<br></p><p>This wide-eyed, magical tale by distinguished author Alice Hoffman reflects the pale blue hue of two 12-year-old friends about to be parted at summer's end. Hailey and Claire have lived next door to each other and have been best friends all their lives, but now Claire's family is going to move away to Florida. The two hang out at the neighborhood beach club in the blistering heat, dreading the end of things. The Capri Beach Club, too, is coming to an end--neglected and shabby, due to be bulldozed at the end of the season.<p> Despite the girls' fear of change, everything shifts with a summer storm. At the beach club the next morning, Hailey and Claire find that the storm has left its mark, filling the cloudy waters of the swimming pool with jellyfish and seaweed. Hailey boldly dives in and discovers that the waves have also brought a delicate blue and white mermaid who is extremely grouchy at her predicament. The girls scheme to return the fish-woman to the sea, but she obstinately refuses to leave the vicinity of Raymond, the handsome boy who runs the gift shop. Alarmed at the mermaid's growing weakness, Hailey and Claire extract her promise to go back to the sea in exchange for one evening with Raymond. They set up a blind date, dress her in a long blue dress to hide her tail, and take her to the rendezvous in a wheelchair. But the next morning the dying mermaid is in love, and the patio is full of partygoers. Can the girls sneak her past all those eyes to save her life? And will she let them? Young teens will be entranced by the strange dreaminess of this poignant little story about love and loss. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>Dear Reader, <p> In the summer when I was twelve, my best friend Carol and I spent every day together at a beach club, dropped off in the mornings and picked up again at night. In many ways, it was a miraculous summer, the season that separated our lives from the children we had been to the teenagers we were about to become. It was a time when everything was more than it ever had been before: the sky more blue, the sea more green, our own tears more salty, our joys more blissful. Anything seemed possible. Our whole lives were open to us, at least for that singular summer. Not long afterward, Carol's family moved away, and although we feared for our friendship, much as the girls in Aquamarine do, we discovered that real friendship can last. </p><p> I still believe what we experience from the ages of ten to fourteen stays with us with unmatched intensity. For this reason, I wanted to write for this age group, and Aquamarine's story began as a tale told to my own son while we floated in a turquoise pool one hot summer day. It had been a difficult time for our family. My sister-in-law, Jo Ann, who had been my dear friend from the time we were nineteen, was battling brain cancer. As she grew weaker she lost the ability to walk, and then to move at all. She became taken with mermaids, those beautiful creatures who have no need of legs or of the air we breathe. We brought Jo Ann mermaid jewelry and mermaid mobiles and mermaid postcards, and now, at last, I bring to her memory the story of Aquamarine, who, like Jo Ann, hasn't the ability to live in our everyday world. </p><p> Some things live forever however, love and friendship among them. And some summers stay with you forever, as well. Here is the story of a mermaid found by two best friends who will clearly never lose one another.</p></p><h2>Felix Longoria&#39;s Wake: Bereavement, Racism, and the Rise of Mexican American Activism (CMAS History, Culture, and Society Series)</h2><p><p><b>Winner, Tullis Prize, Texas State Historical Association, 2004</b></p><p>Private First Class Felix Longoria earned a Bronze Service Star, a Purple Heart, a Good Conduct Medal, and a Combat Infantryman's badge for service in the Philippines during World War II. Yet the only funeral parlor in his hometown of Three Rivers, Texas, refused to hold a wake for the slain soldier because "the whites would not like it." Almost overnight, this act of discrimination became a defining moment in the rise of Mexican American activism. It launched Dr. H�ctor P. Garc�a and his newly formed American G.I. Forum into the vanguard of the Mexican civil rights movement, while simultaneously endangering and advancing the career of Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, who arranged for Longoria's burial with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.</p><p>In this book, Patrick Carroll provides the first fully researched account of the Longoria controversy and its far-reaching consequences. Drawing on extensive documentary evidence and interviews with many key figures, including Dr. Garc�a and Mrs. Longoria, Carroll convincingly explains why the Longoria incident, though less severe than other acts of discrimination against Mexican Americans, ignited the activism of a whole range of interest groups from Argentina to Minneapolis. By putting Longoria's wake in a national and international context, he also clarifies why it became such a flash point for conflicting understandings of bereavement, nationalism, reason, and emotion between two powerful cultures&#x2014;Mexicanidad and Americanism.</p></p><p>Patrick J. Carroll is Professor of History at Texas A&amp;M University, Corpus Christi.&#34;Carroll provides abundant evidence of the importance of the Longoria incident for Mexican Americans, for a rising Lyndon Johnson, for Texas politics, and, indirectly, for U.S. society.

Although the spring equinox was soon to arrive, winter had not given up. As evidence even a few wayward snowflakes swirled down out of the low cloud cover, which was churning like a witch&#x2019;s brew. With the temperature hovering in the mid-thirties these microscopically intricate and strikingly beautiful crystalline structures were immediately metamorphosed into mere droplets of water the instant they touched any terrestrial surface. In sharp contrast to this wanton destruction of nature&#x2019;s handiwork, the situation was the opposite inside a cozily decorated one-bedroom 4th floor walkup apartment on 23rd Street. Within the literal and figurative indoor warmth, a cascade of cellular events had begun that was ultimately the absolute opposite of the dissolution of the snowflakes. Here there was to be a progression of vastly increasing order and complexity initiated by the forcible ejection of more than a 100 million eager sperm into a vaginal vault. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The individuals involved in this amorous event were blissfully unaware of the miraculous drama they had initiated nor of its ultimate dire consequences for both of them. Thoroughly intoxicated by the passion of the moment and forsaking contraception, they had given no thought to the possibility there would be an almost simultaneous release of a receptive ovum from the female&#x2019;s right ovary. Nor did they consider how determined sperm are in fulfilling their singular desire to fuse with a receptive female equivalent.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two and a half hours later when the woman was contentedly fast asleep and the man likewise in his own apartment, the fastest-swimming sperm, following a perilous and Herculean marathon from the depths of the vagina to the internal end of the right fallopian tube, collided head-on with the passively descending ovum. Powered by an irresistible reflex, this winning sperm rapidly burrowed between the cloud of cumulus cells surrounding the ovum to hit up against the ovum&#x2019;s tough covering. A moment later he injected his pronucleus into the ovum to allow his 23 chromosomes to pair with the ovum&#x2019;s 23, forming the normal human cell complement of 46. The ovum had now become a zygote. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, on this nasty New York March 6th night, one of the most astounding miracles of the known universe had been initiated: human GENESIS. Although such episodes of fertilization currently occur in the staggering neighborhood of 350,000 times a day on a world-wide basis, which clouds peoples&#x2019; appreciation by its repetition, it begins a process of &nbsp;truly wonderous, dumbfounding complexity. As a single cell that can barely be seen by the naked eye, the human zygote contains all the data and instructions in its microscopic DNA library necessary to form and operate a human body. &nbsp;That means without any additional informational input the single-celled zygote it is capable of orchestrating the origin of some 37 trillion cells of two hundred different varieties as well as several billion extraordinarily specific, large-molecule proteins that must be formed according to exacting standards at just the right time, in just the right amount, and at just the right location. The human brain alone with its 100 billion cells and more than 100 trillion synaptic connections might be the most complex structure in the universe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By March 11th, five days after the lovemaking that initiated this particular ongoing miracle of human genesis, the rapidly developing conceptus reached the uterus to begin its implantation in the uterine wall. Soon it would make its presence known, proclaiming that a pregnancy had begun. From then on, all that was needed for the birth of a human infant in approximately nine months was basic nutrients, the removal of waste, and physical protection. Unfortunately, in a terribly tragic fashion these required needs were destined not to be maintained in this pregnancy even though everything else in the stunning process was right on track.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> May 5th <br> 10:05 pm<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a shower was a Zen experience for 28-year-old social worker Kera Jacobsen, especially after a tense weekend. Being careful not to fall since her bathtub&#x2019;s curved, porcelain coated bottom could be treacherously slippery, she stepped in, yanking the shower curtain closed in the process. She had already adjusted the water temperature to the near-scalding heat she preferred. After wetting her body thoroughly, she began to scrub herself with the help of a fragrant&nbsp; gel and a long handle shower brush, washing away the stresses of the day and calming her general anxieties. She&#x2019;d been experiencing more than her share of both lately.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kera had been in New York City for just under six months. Coming to the Big Apple had been a rather sudden decision. She&#x2019;d grown up in Los Angeles, obtained her master&#x2019;s degree at UCLA, and had held a position in social work at the UCLA Mattel Children&#x2019;s Hospital. Her specialty was working with children with complex needs and their families. It was demanding work and often emotionally draining although ultimately fulfilling. There was no doubt that her efforts made a big difference and were an important complement to the work of the doctors and nurses who were understandably focused on cure and alleviating immediate symptoms of the disease process rather than the bigger picture of how families and individuals coped. In this capacity she&#x2019;d been content and professionally satisfied. What ended up rocking her world was the sudden and unexpected end the previous September of a long-term relationship with a medical student named Robert Barlow. Over the course of the two and a half years they had dated, they frequently spent the night at the other&#x2019;s abode. With similar interests, including a shared liberal political orientation, they were never at a loss for conversation, which occasionally included discussions of future plans with the standing assumption it would be together. His intention was to take a surgical residency at one of the well-known academic medical centers, preferably there in LA or, if not, possibly San Francisco. As a particularly dedicated student, he was hopeful he&#x2019;d have his choice. Kera had assumed that she would follow if he were to head up to San Fran. With her sterling credentials she was confident she could get a job at any academic medical center.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it wasn&#x2019;t to be, and Kera still had no idea of exactly what had happened, although she had heard through the UCLA Medical Center grapevine that Robert had been seen frequently in the company of one of the surgical department&#x2019;s first year female residents. Nonetheless and with zero warning whatsoever, Robert had informed her one hot, smoggy L.A. afternoon that their relationship was over. <br> Having suffered a big blow to her self-esteem, Kera felt the urgent need to fly the coop. Mutual friends kept asking what had happened between her and Robert, pretending to be sympathetic but actually loving the drama and gossip. Besides, there were just too many chances of inadvertently running into Robert in and around the medical center. On top of all that, Kera always had had a soft spot for New York City, coupled with being tired of the monotony of Los Angeles weather, its uptick of annual forest fires, and the ever-present threat of San Andreas Fault activity. A few weeks after Robert&#x2019;s shocking news, she decided to turn an emotional whammy into something positive and made the cross-country move.<br> After rinsing the soap off her body, Kera squeezed a dollop of shampoo into the palm of her hand and began to wash her hair. This was the part of the shower that she liked the best, and she used considerable force as she worked up copious suds to massage her scalp, trying to blank her mind. <br> At first the move to New York had been positive in all respects except for the continued disappointment voiced by her mother and sister who claimed they missed her terribly. Kera had managed to get a commitment for a social work job at the NYU Langone Medical Center&#x2014;specifically with the Hassenfield Children&#x2019;s Hospital&#x2014;before leaving L.A., so employment hadn&#x2019;t been an issue. As for an apartment, she lucked out by responding to an ad on one of the Langone Medical Center&#x2019;s bulletin boards that had been posted by a nurse who had opted to join the Peace Corps. The listing was for the sublet of a furnished, rent-controlled one bedroom on 23rd Street just off Second Avenue. More importantly, from the standpoint of her self-image, Kera also found herself involved in a whirlwind affair with an attractive, highly accomplished, and older and more mature man than Robert, whom she met over the December holidays. <br> Unfortunately, her life had taken another unexpected and unpleasant turn, and she had begun to question her judgement as well as her gullibility. Once again, she was experiencing disappointment and self-esteem issues&#x2014;perhaps not as precipitously as with Robert, yet she was disturbed enough to have started seriously to consider returning to Southern California. As she expected, her mother and sister were absolutely thrilled with the possibility when she&#x2019;d called them that evening to broach the subject, even though both had immediately questioned what seemed like a sudden change of heart. Only a month earlier in a similar group chat Kera had impressed them with how deliriously happy she was living in the Big Apple. Unprepared to share any details, &nbsp;Kera merely carried on about having come to the realization of how important close family connections were to her. She felt a twinge of guilt at not having been forthright, but the truth was that she hadn&#x2019;t completely made up her mind. There was still a vestige of hope that things might improve, although the chances weren&#x2019;t good. <br> Kera turned off the shower after making sure all the soap and shampoo had been completely rinsed. With her bath towel in hand, she stepped from the tub. Bending at the waist, she rapidly towel dried her thick, moderately long hair, which she considered the only contribution her emotionally unavailable father had provided her. As she straightened, she subconsciously glanced at her profile in the full-length mirror attached to the back of the bathroom door. When it occurred to her what she was doing, she laughed at herself. It was far too early to see any change. <br> Finished with drying herself, Kera was about to hang up her bath towel when her buzzer sounded in the other room, announcing that someone was downstairs at the building&#x2019;s front door. The sudden raucous sound &nbsp;cut through the quiet apartment like a hot knife through butter, shattering the peacefulness Kera had been experiencing. Tossing her towel over the edge of the bathtub and grabbing her robe from the clothes hook, Kera dashed out to the tiny kitchen where the ancient intercom was mounted on the wall. As she pressed the &#x2018;talk&#x2019; button and asked who was there, she noticed the time on the microwave oven. It was 10:23. Since she hadn&#x2019;t ordered any take-out and there was only one person who would possibly ring her bell at such an hour, although never without a text or call, she was reasonably sure who it was. The possibility didn&#x2019;t thrill her. She&#x2019;d been trying to calm herself prior to getting into bed.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; the expected masculine voice said.<br> &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Kera questioned. She leaned close to the speakerphone. She had to press the vintage device&#x2019;s &#x2018;talk&#x2019; button each time she spoke and then let go to listen. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about the hour, but I need to talk with you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just getting out of the shower. How about tomorrow around lunchtime?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I need to talk with you tonight. I&#x2019;ve had a change of mind, and I want to share it with you. I need to share it with you.&#x201d;<br> Kera paused even as her pulse quickened. After everything that had happened and everything that had been said over the previous month, there was no way she could be at all certain what he meant by &#x2018;a change of mind.&#x2019; She could guess. But was it wishful thinking? After all, he had been painfully and consistently clear over a period of weeks. Still, if he meant what she thought he might, it would change everything.<br> &#x201c;What kind of change of mind?&#x201d; Kera asked finally, lowering her guard. She didn&#x2019;t want to get her hopes up only to have them dashed on the proverbial rocks all over again.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve realized you were right all along, and I was wrong. It just took me some time to figure it out. We need to celebrate!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Celebrate?&#x201d; Kera questioned to be sure she&#x2019;d heard correctly.<br> &#x201c;Yes, celebrate. And I&#x2019;ve brought the makings.&#x201d;<br> Trying to contain her excitement, Kera hit the &#x2018;door open&#x2019; button. Then she fled back to the bathroom, pulling on her robe in the process. She had been standing naked, clutching the robe to her chest the whole time she&#x2019;d been on the intercom. Once in the bathroom she grabbed her hairbrush and tried to tame the wet mop on top of her head. It wasn&#x2019;t working. She felt she looked dreadful, but there was no time to do anything about it. Cinching the tie on her robe and with a final desperate pat to her hair, she was back out to the door to begin disengaging the panoply of locks and chains the renter of record had installed. Just as she&#x2019;d finished, there was a furtive knock. <br> With a final check through the peephole, Kera pulled open the door. Her visitor was wearing a dark fedora and a dark overcoat she&#x2019;d never seen. Before she could greet him, he swooped into the room, closed the door, and enveloped her in an embrace that took her breath away. Only then did he put down the shopping bag he was carrying and remove his hat and coat, which he tossed onto the couch.<br> &#x201c;As I said, we have to celebrate,&#x201d; he announced with great fanfare. He then proceeded to take out several impressive cut crystal fluted Champagne glasses followed by a chilled bottle of ros� prosecco nestled in a thermal sleeve and finally, a small package of cocktail napkins. &#x201c;Check this out!&#x201d; he said, showing the bottle to Kera as if he were a sommelier.<br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Kera said while reading the striking black label. &#x201c;Bortolomiol Finlanda Ros�. I&#x2019;ve never heard of it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fabulous,&#x201d; he said proudly, &#x201c;and remarkably hard to find.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What exactly are we celebrating?&#x201d; Kera asked hesitantly while he struggled with the wire securing the bottle&#x2019;s cork. This kind of response from him was what she&#x2019;d hoped and had expected when she&#x2019;d originally broken the news. She&#x2019;d been crushed when it hadn&#x2019;t happened. <br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re celebrating everything,&#x201d; he said triumphantly. &#x201c;The fact is, you were right, and I was wrong. What&#x2019;s happened is truly a miracle that was meant to be. I just didn&#x2019;t see it in the heat of the moment.&#x201d;<br> Kera could have pointed out that he&#x2019;d taken far longer than a moment to come to the realization; in fact, there had been nearly a...</p><h2>Everyday Cooking With Jacques Pepin</h2><p>Fresh from his television show, &#34;Everyday Cooking With Jacques Pepin,&#34; the personal chef of three French presidents discusses cooking techniques and presents numerous recipes and money- and time-saving hints</p><p></p><h2>Old Penang (Images of Asia)</h2><p>For centuries Penang was part of the Muslim state of Kedah, but after the intervention in 1786 of a `forgotten' English trader, Captain Francis Light, it became a British mercantile and shipping outpost, administered as part of British India and renamed Prince of Wales Island.

It was altogether a perfect day for a family outing. Certainly it did not occur to Vicky to wonder about what the approaching, more bitter season would hold for her.What she was thinking about more than anything else as they drove along the winding country road was the ten-speed bicycle she hoped to get for her birthday.Her father looked briefly back at her from the driver's seat and smiled. "You haven't said a word for miles, Vicky," he said. "Something on your mind?""Oh," she said dreamily, trying not to make the hint too obvious, "I was just thinking about what a wonderful place this would be to go for rides on a brand new, ten--""Wait! Stop!" her mother cried out, startling Vicky and not giving her a chance to finish. Her father pulled the car abruptly over to the side of the road where there was a hand-lettered ANTIQUES sign nailed to a tree. Vicky sighed. Her mother was always searching for old phonograph records and sheet music.Her father winked at Vicky. "It won't take long," he said, and they followed her mother up to the dilapidated wooden farmhouse that sagged behind the sign.It was dark inside, and there was a moldy basement smell. The room was so crowded with old dusty things that there were only a few narrow corridors for walking. While her mother rummaged through tattered piles, Vicky drifted circuitously through the dimness, trying to decide whether she wanted a yellow bike or a blue one, with racing handlebars, of course, but should the tape be--Suddenly, from the other side of the room, her father exclaimed over something. Her mother hurried over to him, and they exchanged a few excited whispers. The old woman who had let them in, who was so fat that her legs bent outward and she had to hobble with a cane, seemed particularly pleased about whatever it was they had noticed. Her toothless mouth puckered into a smile; she stood up a littlestraighter and brushed the hair out of her eyes.To Vicky's relief they left the farmhouse soon after that, taking nothing with them. As they drove away Vicky caught one last glimpse of the old woman staring at them from the shadowy doorway, her wrinkled face eager with curiosity. Vicky forgot her immediately, however."It really is beautiful here," she said dreamily. "The perfect place to go for long rides on a brand new, ten-speed bike."But her parents, who were now preoccupied in an odd way, did not seem to hear her.&nbsp;<br>As her birthday approached, her parents grew more and more excited. Vicky was sure they had gotten her the bicycle. And when finally the day arrived and they told her the present was too big to wrap and had been hidden in the basement, she was certain. Hardly daring to look, she kept her eyes closed, hopping with anticipation, as they led her down the stairs.When she opened her eyes and saw, not the gleaming, streamlined vision she had been imagining, but a musty antique dollhouse with old-fashioned, faded furniture and dolls, her disappointment was too great to hide. Her parents beamed proudly, waiting for herto respond. All she could do was mumble something and look down at her feet.Vicky cried easily, and the tears started just after her father had carried the dollhouse up to her room. There it sat on the floor across from her bed. It was nearly as tall as she was, and its dark gray Mansard roof and shadowy little rooms cast an aura of gloom over her bright bedroom. All at once she realized that she would have to be alone with it at night. It was the thought of that thing watching and waiting in the darkness, even more than her disappointment about the bicycle, that suddenly brought on her tears.She struggled to get down her ice cream and cake while her parents asked her over and over again what was wrong. At first they seemed bewildered, then disappointed, as though it were somehow Vicky's fault that the day had gone badly. All of Vicky's explanations seemed childish and silly, and at last they stopped asking. Her mother took away her half-empty plate briskly, without a word. It was undoubtedly the worst birthday she had ever had.&nbsp;<br>The dollhouse was the first thing she saw when she woke up the day after her birthday, and she turned her head quickly away from it. But, though she triedat first, the dollhouse was impossible to ignore. Not only was it so large, but now she began to be aware that it held a peculiar fascination for her.She looked more closely at the dolls that belonged in it. With a strange reluctance, she picked them up one by one and turned them over in her hands. There were four of them: a mother, a father, another woman, who she decided must be the aunt, and a little girl. They were all old, and somehow seemed to share the atmosphere of the house, as though they had lived in it for years and years.And that was what gave her the idea that what the dollhouse needed was one more doll. If there could be something new in it, something that she chose herself, then perhaps the atmosphere would change just a little. She might even dislike the house less.At first, her mother objected. It was always a mistake to interrupt her when she was playing the old upright piano in the kitchen, but Vicky was too hopeful of her new idea to wait."But it won't fit in with the other dolls," her mother explained, sighing, her hands still resting on the keys. "Everything in that house is an antique, it all belongs together. Something new would destroy the atmosphere."But that, of course, was just what Vicky wanted;and at last her mother relented. She gave her some money, and Vicky dashed out of the house to the strains of an impatient Chopin Waltz.Most of the miniature dolls in the department store resembled tall and thin young women, like fashion models. Vicky lingered over them for awhile, but at last decided against any of them. Not only did they seem to be too large, but there was also something in their blank and cold expressions that reminded her of the dolls already in the dollhouse. At last she came upon a small plastic toddler with a head too large for his body, a pathetic little face, and short, fat arms and legs. He seemed to be just the right size, and, more important, radiated innocence and a gleaming newness.When she first set him down with the other dolls in the conservatory he stood out uncomfortably, pink and shiny among the gray, dusty figures. But somehow his presence was just what she needed to overcome her repugnance. She began to give in to the pull of the dollhouse.And it was actually rather amusing to play with the dolls. The mother and the aunt would cook and clean; the father would read and work at his desk; the children played with their toys. They gathered around the dining room table at mealtimes, and retired to their beds at night. It was all very calm andpleasant; until one night at dinner the doll family began to fight.At first there were nothing but uncomfortable little squabbles. The brother would refuse to eat and the mother would send him to his room. The sister would grab one of his toys and claim it was hers. The mother would criticize the father; the aunt would complain that she was working too hard. Gradually, the quarrelsome life in the dollhouse became more dramatic, and day by day more fascinating to Vicky--especially as her own life began to change.School was a trial for Vicky. She was shy, and never seemed to make any friends. Home had always been the place where she could find peace and comfort. But now that was no longer true.One day her mother fell down the stairs, breaking her hand, and she was different after that. She couldn't play the piano, and in her frustration began bullying Vicky's father, who strangely enough seemed to be unable to stand up for himself. Nor would he stand up for Vicky anymore, but instead would retire to his basement study when her mother began to scold. And now she scolded and nagged more than she ever had before, criticizing Vicky about her poor grades in school, about the fact that she had no friends. It was so bad that Vicky hardlydared to approach her. Mealtimes were agony.As her own life became worse, the dolls' arguments grew more intense. The mother doll began to strike the children, to throw things at them, and the daughter would scream insults back at her. The aunt would brutally scrub the children's faces and hands and lock them in their room without supper. The mother would then berate the father, who would fling himself upon his bed and sob.And then the day came when Vicky brought home her report card, the worst report card she had ever received. When her mother saw what was on it, she flew into a rage and slapped Vicky across the face. She had never struck her before.The dollhouse that day was blurred through Vicky's tears. Almost too miserable to play, she moved the dolls about dispiritedly, sending the daughter up to her room for throwing food, then creating a long argument between the mother and father over the lunch table, which ended in his retreating to his bed. She had just been about to take the daughter out of her room, when the sunlight coming in through the window had dimmed. Vicky looked up, then felt suddenly dizzy and closed her eyes.When she opened them she was inside the dollhouse.Copyright � 1975 by William Sleator</p><h2>The Legend of the Sleepers (Penguin Modern)</h2><p><p><i>'For once there had been false idols and asses' heads drawn on the walls...' </i></p><p>Sleepers awake in a remote cave and the ancient mystic Simon Magus attempts a miracle, in these two magical, otherworldly tales from one of the greatest voices of twentieth-century Europe.</p><p>Penguin Modern: fifty new books celebrating the pioneering spirit of the iconic Penguin Modern Classics series, with each one offering a concentrated hit of its contemporary, international flavour.

Lee&#39;s Bad Old Man</h2><p>In Jubal Early: Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s Bad Old Man, a new critical biography of Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Anderson Early, Civil War historian B.F. Cooling III takes a fresh look at one of the most fascinating, idiosyncratic characters in the pantheon of Confederate heroes and villains. Dubbed by Robert E. Lee as his "bad old man" because of his demeanor, Early was also Lee's chosen instrument to attack and capture Washington as well as defend the Shenandoah Valley granary in the summer and fall of 1864. Neither cornered nor snared by Union opponents, Early came closest of any Confederate general to capturing Washington, ending Lincoln's presidency, and forever changing the fate of the Civil War and American history. His failure to grapple with this moment of historical immortality and emerge victorious bespeaks as much his own foibles as the counter-efforts of the enemy, the effects of weather and the shortcomings of his army. From the pinnacle of success, Jubal Early descended to the trough of defeat within three months when opponent General Philip Sheridan resoundingly defeated him in the Valley campaign of 1864.<br><br>Jubal Early famously exhibited a harder, less gallant personal as a leading Confederate practitioner of "hard" or destructive war, a tactic usually ascribed to Union generals Hunter, Sheridan, and Sherman. An extortionist of Yankee capital in northern towns in Pennsylvania and Maryland&#x2014;typically in the form of tribute&#x2014;Early also became forever associated with the wanton destruction of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, as well as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens private commerical ironworks, and the private dwellings of Maryland governor Augustus Bradford and then Postmaster General Montgomery Blair. How war hardened a crabbed, arthritically hobbled but brilliantly pragmatic soldier and lawyer offers one of the most fascinating puzzles of personality in Civil War history.<br><br>One of the most alluring yet repellent figures of Southern Confederate history, Jubal Early would devolve from the ideal prewar constitutional unionist to the postwar personification of the unreconstructed rebel and progenitor of the &#x201c;lost cause&#x201d; explanation for the demise of the Confederacy's experiment in rebellion or independence. This critical study explains how one of Virginia's loyal sons came through war and peace to garner a unique position in the Confederacy's pantheon of heroes&#x2014;and the Union&#x2019;s cabal of military villains. <br><br>Jubal Early: Robert E.

Hutton's clear prose tells much, but its brevity may raise many questions. Nonetheless, children will be caught up in the action-packed adventure. The watercolor art is as typically graceful as that on a Greek vase--blue, green, and gold with touches of russet. Perseus is beautiful, smooth-skinned with no muscles. Medusa looks like an ancient tribal mask, not frightening, but true to the old retellings that describe her as having tusks and a thick tongue. However, the Medusa of the mind's eye is more awe-inspiring. No other picture book editions are currently available. Longer retellings are certainly more satisfying, but this could be used to introduce the myth to primary graders. --Helen Gregory, Grosse Pointe Public Library, MI<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hutton's customarily expressive watercolors bring both beauty and solemnity to the tale of Medusa's slayer. Cast adrift at birth because of a prophecy that he would one day kill his grandfather, Perseus is manipulated into pursuit of the hideous Gorgon's head by a king who desires his mother--and who is, of course, later turned to stone when Perseus displays his bounty. The vistas Hutton portrays, many of which suggest vast expanses of sea and sky under an unchanging, seemingly pitiless sun, form an eloquent, ironic commentary on the struggles and frequent cruelty of mankind--struggles to which not even the gods are inured. (One of the most powerful scenes depicts a seated, diminutive Perseus bathed in moonlight at Athene's and Hermes's feet.) The myth itself may have less contemporary resonance than others interpreted by this artist: in it, for example, beauty and goodness are closely and repeatedly allied. And, uncharacteristically, Hutton leaves the story open-ended, never returning to the prophecy whose eventual fulfillment is an integral part of the myth. Still, an evocative interpretation of a cornerstone of Greek lore.

His book offers a unique view of our country and some of her leaders of the past 100 years. 12 photos.</p><p>Caspar W. Weinberger served in cabinet positions in the Nixon, Ford, and Reagan administrations, as well as in the California legislature and governor&#x2019;s office. During the Second World War, he served with the Forty-first Infantry Division and later as a member of General Douglas MacArthur&#x2019;s intelligence staff. He has been awarded the Medal of Freedom with Distinction, been named an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II, and received the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun from Japan. A proud graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, he is currently chairman of Forbes, Inc. When not traveling the world for Forbes, he divides his time between Maine, New York, and Washington, D.C.<p>Weinberger's service to former presidents Nixon and Reagan spanned years that dramatically changed America and the world, so one would think that his autobiography might offer fresh and valuable insights into the events of those years. Alas, this is not the case. Even more regrettable, Weinberger reveals very little of himself. While one learns a great deal about the facts of his life (some of them very trivial, like the type of house he lived in while in Washington), one doesn't come to understand what motivated him in politics. It is particularly disappointing not to find some clues to the paradox of "Cap the Knife," as he was known, the dreaded budget cutter in the Nixon administration's Office of Management and Budget who then staunchly championed every spending request of the Department of Defense. Weinberger does carefully chronicle his life and dutifully notes his accomplishments; however, he is largely uncritical of those for whom he worked especially Reagan, a man he clearly worships and of his own activities.

The father is a professional storyteller. One day his wife leaves him to run off with a little clerk. The author also wrote &#34;Grimus&#34;, &#34;Midnight&#39;s Children&#34;, &#34;Shame&#34; and &#34;The Satanic Verses&#34;.</p><p>Immediately forget any preconceptions you may have about Salman Rushdie and the controversy that has swirled around his million-dollar head. You should instead know that he is one of the best contemporary writers of fables and parables, from any culture. <i>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</i> is a delightful tale about a storyteller who loses his skill and a struggle against mysterious forces attempting to block the seas of inspiration from which all stories are derived. Here's a representative passage about the sources and power of inspiration: <blockquote> So Iff the water genie told Haroun about the Ocean of the Stream of Stories, and even though he was full of a sense of hopelessness and failure the magic of the Ocean began to have an effect on Haroun. He looked into the water and saw that it was made up of a thousand thousand thousand and one different currents, each one a different colour, weaving in and out of one another like a liquid tapestry of breathtaking complexity; and Iff explained that these were the Streams of Story, that each coloured strand represented and contained a single tale. Different parts of the Ocean contained different sorts of stories, and as all the stories that had ever been told and many that were still in the process of being invented could be found here, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was in fact the biggest library in the universe. And because the stories were held here in fluid form, they retained the ability to change, to become new versions of themselves, to join up with other stories and so become yet other stories; so that unlike a library of books, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was much more than a storeroom of yarns. It was not dead, but alive. <p> "And if you are very, very careful, or very, very highly skilled, you can dip a cup into the Ocean," Iff told Haroun, "like so," and here he produced a little golden cup from another of his waistcoat pockets, "and you can fill it with water from a single, pure Stream of Story, like so," as he did precisely that. </p></blockquote><b>Salman Rushdie</b> is the author of eleven novels&#x2014;<i>Grimus</i>, <i>Midnight&#x2019;s Children</i> (for which he won the Booker Prize and the Best of the Booker), <i>Shame</i>, <i>The Satanic Verses</i>, <i>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</i>, <i>The Moor&#x2019;s Last Sigh</i>, <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</i>, <i>Fury</i>, <i>Shalimar the Clown</i>, <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i>, and <i>Luka and the Fire of Life</i>&#x2014;and one collection of short stories: <i>East, West</i>.

The woman was, of course, Anna Nicole Smith. This is the story of the little girl from west of nowhere, born into a broken, dysfunctional, dirt-poor family, told by the one woman who knew her best - her sister. Her fierce resolve, pluck, luck and determination allowed her to claw her way to celebrity status, becoming a tabloid staple, and to reach the potential of unimaginable wealth. And then, in a moment, she was gone, not yet 40 years old.

As a youth, he studied under Lewis Hine and went on to draw acclaim from such illustrious sources as Alfred Stieglitz. After World War II, Strand traveled around the world to photograph, and, in the process, created a dynamic and significant body of work. A major retrospective of his work was shown at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in October 2014.This rich publication accompanying a major retrospective traveling exhibition commemorates the centennial of Strand's birth (1890). Undisputably one of America's most important photographers, Strand took his inspiration from everyday life, trying to reveal the spirit of individual objects and exploring the relationships between people, objects, and their environment. In addition to his memorable portraits and still-lifes from New York and scenes from Taos, Mexico, Italy, France, and New England, Strand made many important films, such as Manhattan (1920), The Plow That Broke the Plains (1935), and Native Land (1942). Distinguishing this book are highly faithful reproductions of 104 black-and-white photographs , accomplished by a new six-color printing process, and 40 more printed in duotone. Including a number of newly published images, a fine essay by Sarah Greenough chronicling Strand's life and work, and letters and published writings by him, this book is highly recommended despite the high price.<br><i>- Ann Copeland, Champaign, Ill.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Clash: A History of U.S.-Japan Relations</h2><p>Presents an in-depth study of how the U.S. and Japan, with divergent political orientations, have competed and collided with each other and explains why the relationship remains immensely important, highly fragile, and misunderstood on both sides of the Pacific.</p><p>Walter LaFeber is the author of eight other books, including The American Age and Inevitable Revolutions (both from Norton). He is the Marie Underhill Noll Professor of History and a Steven Weiss Presidential Teaching Fellow at Cornell University where he has taught since 1959. He lives in Ithaca, New York.A scholar's perceptive rundown on the contentiousness that has defined America's relations with Japan down through the years. Drawing on archival and other sources, LaFeber (The American Age, 1988, etc.) offers an even-handed account of the deep-rooted conflicts that have kept the two nations at odds right from the start, i.e., the mid-1853 moment when Commodore Perry swept into Yedo Bay with a letter from President Millard Fillmore inviting the emperor of Japan to open his insular, feudal country (which then traded only with the Chinese and Dutch) to the US. He goes on to document the consistent way in which Washington has viewed Asia as a frontier that must remain open to trade while Tokyo (with an eye to retaining control over its foreign policy and, hence, domestic order) was ever intent on barring offshore capital and goods from home markets. At critical junctures, notes the author (History/Cornell Univ.), the focus of the resulting commercial conflicts has been mainland China; cases in point range from the preWW I era (when the Meiji Restoration brought Japan into the industrial age) through WW I and into the 1970s, when Japan emerged as an economic force. LaFeber also records how cultural divergences, in particular, vastly different approaches to governance, competition, and capitalism, have created constant friction over time. Closer to the present, he reviews how the Cold War's abrupt end reduced Japan's value to the US as a strategic partner in the struggle against communism, albeit without resolving many of the seemingly intractable disputes that have long kept the two rivals for Pacific Basin riches at loggerheads. A ready one-volume reference to a protracted confrontation that has consequential implications for the whole of the Global Village.

In this, his third major book, Heinrich Himmler, Head of the SS, emerges as a man with a huge personal agenda. Having secured for himself an unassailable position by manipulating Hitler into wiping out the SS&#39;s left-wing rivals, the SA, in The Night of the Long Knives, he continued to nurture political supremacy for himself while Hitler fought his military war. At the heart of Himmler&#39;s Secret War is the turning point of the war when, following the German defeat at Stalingrad, Himmler recognized that Germany would lose. Through his trusted envoy, Walter Schellenberg, he devoted much energy to negotiating his intended post-war role as the man who would lead Germany. He believed his intermediary, the British Ambassador in Sweden, Victor Mallet, was in direct contact with Winston Churchill. In fact, he was the victim of a highly effective sting by the Political Warfare Executive (PWE).</p><p>Martin Allen is a leading authority on the Second World War. His particular skill lies in searching out witnesses and documents for information other historians have missed. His first book, Hidden Agenda, covering the Duke of Windsor&#39;s wartime activities, was nominated as Observer Book of the Year and published in the USA, France, Germany, Spain, and Portugal. Allen&#39;s second book, The Hitler/Hess Deception, blew open the official version of Rudolph Hess as an eccentric adventurer and was published in seven languages and widely serialized. In this, his third book on political warfare in the Second World War, Martin Allen reveals Britian&#39;s top secret war of wits pitted against the German leadership to undermine Nazi Germany politically, and thereby ensure that Britian would emerge victorious in 1945.</p><h2>Familiar Spirits: A Practical Guide for Witches &amp; Magicians</h2><p>For centuries, familiars have assumed many forms-the heavenly lover of the shaman, the wise imp of the witch, and the elemental companion of the theurgist.

It cannot be more terrible than the previous year, surely?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it can. For many will strive to make it so; to finally rid London of the curse that brought the plague upon it. A wholesale cleansing is required if society is to be born again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's more it seems that a serial killer who stalked hand in hand with the Plague might not be dead after all. Together with actress Sarah Chalker, highwayman William Coke and thief-taker Pitman come together as one, determined to stop the brutal murder of London's rich and poor once and for all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But another threat is on the way. It hasn't rained in five months. London is a tinderbox--politically, sexually and religiously. The Great Fire of London is about to ignite. And the final confrontation between Coke, Pitman and Sarah Chalker and their murderous adversary will be decided against a background of apocalypse.</p><p>C.C. HUMPHREYS--born in Toronto, raised in London--is an actor, playwright, fight choreographer and novelist. His first job out of school was as a motorcycle messenger, based in St Giles, where much of <i>Plague</i> and <i>Fire</i> take place. Chris has written nine historical fiction novels including <i>The French Executioner</i>, the Jack Absolute series,&nbsp;<i>Vlad</i> and <i>Shakespeare's Rebel. Fire</i> is a thriller set in London 1666 and follows on from <i>Plague. </i>He&nbsp;lives in Salt Spring Island, BC.<b>National Bestseller<br><br></b>"The brilliance of <i>Fire</i> is that while the villains and their motives are known, the rest of the plot is slowly revealed in an engrossing thriller that shifts from a riverside theatre to the cramped confines of a 17th-century warship and finally to the congested parishes of London.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Readers can smell the bitter ash, hear the pleas of the trapped and see the sparks dance from roof to roof." <i>&#x2014;Maclean's</i><br><br>"<i>Fire</i> unfolds over the course of the summer of 1666, using the reader's knowledge of the coming fire to add a ticking clock to [protagonists] Coke and Pitman's increasingly perilous investigations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well-worth reading." <i>&#x2014;National Post</i><br><b><br></b>"Fast-paced and salacious.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Humphreys' staccato prose drives the plot towards the inevitable trial by fire and a satisfying conclusion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [He] offers up an absorbing and well-wrought blend of heroism and villainy in a story that is ultimately about the danger of unchecked fanaticism and the capacity of bravery to overcome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A lot of fun."&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;Toronto Star</i><br><br>"C.C. Humphreys' new book <i>Fire</i> is a thrilling reimagining of the events of the 1666 Great Fire of London. A perfect book for anyone with a passion for history or crime fiction, this is an exciting read that will keep you enthralled to the last page." <i>&#x2014;Classical 96.3 FM</i><b><br><br>Praise for C.C. Humphreys:</b><br>&nbsp;� "[Humphreys'] books are always a treat to read, immersive and thrilling, but with a depth and skill that elevates them." <i>--The Vancouver Sun</i><br>&nbsp;� "C.C. Humphreys has managed quite a feat: a book about bubonic plague and a serial killer in 17th century London written with a great sense of fun. . . . For a reader whose taste in crime fiction runs more to dark, contemporary Scandinavians, Humphreys was a delightful treat." --<i>Toronto Star</i></p><h2>Armadilly Chili</h2><p>A blue norther&#39;s a-blowing&#39;, and Miss Billie Armadilly is hankering to make a pot of chili! Only she needs to fix it all by herself because Tex the tarantula, Mackie the bluebird, and Taffy the horned toad are too busy to lend a hand.</p><p>Helen Ketteman&#x2019;s Texas-style spin on "The Little Red Hen" is joined by the Southwestern warmth of Will Terry&#x2019;s paintings for a spicy and satisfying story time.I wrote Armadilly Chili because when I was very young and heard the story of The Little Red Hen, I hated the ending of that story.&nbsp; Even as a young child, it didn't feel like a good ending - the little Red Hen and her barnyard friends never did make up with each other - the story ended on a sour note.&nbsp; So when the silly phrase "Armadilly Chili" popped into my crazy brain, I knew EXACTLY what I would do with those words - write a better Little Red Hen story - one with an ending that felt right to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as I always do, I had LOTS of fun playing with the language so that&nbsp;my story&nbsp;would be fun to hear AND fun to read!</p><h2>The Fred Factor</h2><p>Mark Sanborn met his postman, Fred, just after he moved to Denver. Fred knocked on his door, introduced himself and welcomed him to the neighbourhood. He also asked Sanborn about himself and how he wanted his mail handled while he was away. Needless to say, Sanborn was shocked. He asked Fred more about his job and how he approached it. Fred&#39;s answers inspired him to develop motivational seminars promoting Fred&#39;s attitude and approach to life. To embody the Fred philosophy is to realise and practise that:--Everyone can make a difference--Success is built on good relationships--You must continually create value for others and it doesn&#39;t have to cost anything--You can reinvent yourself whenever you want. In this succinct and inspiring guide, Sanborn shows us how we can all truly make a difference everyday and become a &#39;Fred&#39;, as well as how to recognise, reward and attract Freds into our lives.</p><p>&#34; &#34;The Fred Factor&#34; is a powerful, poignant parable of success.

He spent most of his three-year hitch in Manila, "a place where interesting things can happen to a man." This memoir by the author of Miami Blues and The Burnt Orange Heresy is so brutally frank about drinking and whoring in the prePearl Harbor Army that it becomes hilarious when the author remarks, "If a man wasn't careful the Army could coarsen him, and I had to protect my sensitivity if I was ever going to write anything first-rate." Discharged in 1938, Willeford found himself in trouble with the police on Los Angeles's Skid Row, and decided to reenlist. His autobiography is hardboiled and certainly authentic, but short on substance. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Willeford joined the U.S. Army in 1935 at the age of 16. He spent time in the Philippines, in the air corps, and later at Fort Riley, in the cavalry. He recalls some of the less savory aspects of the Depression army, and explains in great detail just how the enlisted men lived. In the four years covered here, he fits in about as many sexual, alcoholic, and military adventures as a young man could reasonably hope to survive. Although this memoir captures the spirit of the prewar army well, its tone of mild braggadocio and its uninspired prose will limit its appeal.

Harris weaves an utterly engaging history of African American cuisine, taking the listener on a harrowing journey from Africa across the Atlantic to America, and tracking the trials that the people and the food have undergone along the way. From chitlins and ham hocks to fried chicken and vegan soul, Harris celebrates the delicious and restorative foods of the African American experience and details how each came to form an important part of African American culture, history, and identity. Although the story of African cuisine in America begins with slavery, <i>High on the Hog</i> ultimately chronicles a thrilling history of triumph and survival.

One creates pressure, the other provides freedom.<br><br>In the Old Way of life, as best-selling author, psychologist, and spiritual director Larry Crabb describes it, &#x201c;you have decided that what you most want out of life is within your reach, and you are doing whatever you believe it takes to get it.&#x201d; But in the New Way of life, &#x201c;you have realized that what you most want is beyond your reach, and you are trusting God for the satisfaction you seek. You want Him. Nothing less, not even His blessings, will do.&#x201d;<br><br>The Old Way&#x2013;the way most Christians define life and pursue fulfillment&#x2013;is fundamentally wrong and harmful. It leaves us tired, in bondage, and feeling distant from God. But the New Way brings true freedom and refreshment as we tap into the power to draw closer to God in a personal way.<br><br><i>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t always make life work. But we can </i>always<i> draw near to God. There is a different way to approach our problems. There is a NEW WAY to live.&#x201d; &#x2014;Larry Crabb</i></p><p><b>Dr. Larry Crabb</b> is the founder of New Way Ministries and a best-selling author, psychologist, and spiritual director who is known internationally not only through his many books, but also as a leading seminar and conference speaker for the past two decades. Some of his landmark books include <i>Inside Out, Finding God, The Marriage Builder, Connecting,</i> and <i>Shattered Dreams. </i>Larry currently serves as Distinguished Scholar in Residence at Colorado Christian University, and has served on the faculties of Regent College, Grace Theological Seminary, Florida Atlantic University, and the University of Illinois. He had a private practice in clinical psychology for ten years. Larry and his wife, Rachael, have two grown sons and two grandchildren, and live near Denver, Colorado.Two Paths<br><br>Right now, at this very moment, you&#x2019;re walking one of two paths through life.<br><br>Either<br><br>you&#x2019;ve decided that what you most want out of life is within your reach, and you&#x2019;re doing whatever you believe it<br>takes to get it<br><br>or<br><br>you&#x2019;ve realized that what you most want is beyond your reach, and you&#x2019;re trusting God for the satisfaction you<br>seek. You want Him. Nothing less, not even His blessings, will do.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re walking the first path, your life is filled with pressure. Inside, where no one sees, your soul is weary. You see no way to step off the treadmill. Or life is going well, and you&#x2019;re satisfied. But you sense something&#x2019;s wrong, something&#x2019;s missing. The pressure is still there. <br><br>If you&#x2019;re walking the second path, you have hope. Your soul may be weary, your interior world may be filled with struggles no one sees, but you have hope. At times you rest. Something is alive in you; the desire of your heart is not smothered. You can taste freedom. And the taste brings joy. The first path is the Old Way. It involves a quid-pro-quo arrangement with God or, if not with God, then with the order in the universe, with the rules that make life work. If you do what you should, then you get what you want, either from a moral God who rewards good behavior or from an<br>orderly world that you effectively use. It leaves you in control of how things turn out in your life. The Old Way promises a better life filled with good things that make you happy.<br><br>But it never delivers, though it may seem to for a long time. The Old Way doesn&#x2019;t work for one reason: You never keep your end of the bargain, not completely. No one does.<br><br>The second path is the New Way. In this arrangement, God first plants a desire in your heart, a longing that actually values His presence over His blessings; then He invites you to live out that desire, to abandon yourself to what you most want. It takes you out of control, but it sets you free. The New Way promises a better hope than the good things of life. It promises nearness to God, and it delivers, though not right away and often through suffering.<br><br>Most people live the Old Way all of their lives; most people who go to church live a religious version of the Old Way. It goes something like this: If you want good kids, raise them according to Christian principles. If you want a good marriage, understand a biblical model for marriage and live up to it as closely as you can.<br><br>If you want God to bless your ministry, follow godly principles of leadership. If you want to be emotionally healthy, practice spiritual disciplines and trust Jesus for your needs.<br><br>If you want close friends, learn to accept yourself and to be vulnerable, authentic, and forgiving.<br><br>People who live the Old Way believe the Law of Linearity, a law that states there is an A that leads to the B you want. Figure out what A is, do it, and you&#x2019;ll have the life you most desire. The pressure&#x2019;s on.<br><br>People who live the New Way believe the Law of Liberty. They come as they are. They do not bathe before they approach God. They come to God for the bath. They feel no pressure to change either their inner life or their outer life, but they desire change in both spheres. And they are eager to do whatever will create the opportunity for change, even if it means dipping themselves seven times in a muddy river or marching around an enemy&#x2019;s wall for seven days and blowing trumpets. They live for the truest desire of their hearts: to know God and to enjoy Him. They do not live for a better life in this world. And when their life here is hard, when things fall apart, they most clearly reveal who they are. They&#x2019;re citizens of another world who most want what this world can never provide. So they wisely indulge their deepest desire and trust God to reveal Himself to them. That&#x2019;s the Law of Liberty.<br><br>Most of us are living the Old Way. Some of us can feel the emptiness it never fills. We&#x2019;re working hard to make life work so we can feel good. The pressure&#x2019;s on.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a new way to live that takes the pressure off.

Among the changes were William Riker's promotion to captain and his new command, Riker's marriage to Counselor Deanna Troi, and Dr. Beverly Crusher's new career at Starfleet Medical. But the story of what set them on a path away from the <i>Starship Enterprise�</i> has never been told. <br><br> <b>UNTIL NOW.</b> <br><br> Following the scandalous Tezwa affair, the Federation president's resignation forces an election, with the future of the United Federation of Planets to be determined by who emerges victorious from a hotly contested vote. But it is the fate of the entire galaxy that may actually be decided on Qo'noS, as the Federation embassy is seized by terrorists whose actions expose intrigue reaching the highest levels of Klingon government -- and it will take all of Ambassador Worf's skills to keep the fragile Federation-Klingon alliance from collapsing. And while this potential intergalactic chaos looms, Commander Riker finds his plans for command and marriage soured by a brutal, high-level inspection of the ship from which the crew may not escape unscathed.... <br><br> The epic miniseries comes to a shocking conclusion -- one that will leave the <i>Star Trek</i> universe changed forever!</p><p><b>Keith R.A.

In the almost four years he had served as Federation ambassador to the Klingon Empire, the one part of his daily routine that he could count on enjoying was the spectacular view of the sun casting its fiery glow across the First City at the top of the day.<br><br>Recent events had dimmed that enthusiasm considerably. The actions of others less honorable had forced Worf into a position where he had to compromise himself in order to serve the greater good. The alternative was to allow an even greater evil, and he could not permit that to happen, regardless of the consequences.<br><br>It was a state of affairs that was all too familiar to the son of Mogh.<br><br>A little more than a month ago, he had used his position -- as an ambassador, and as a member of the Klingon chancellor's House -- to give his former crewmates on the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i> a weapon of sorts that they could use to prevent a Klingon Defense Force fleet from engaging in a suicidal attack on the planet Tezwa. Officially, no one could prove that he provided the <i>Enterprise</i> with the prefix codes that would disable the fleet; unofficially, it couldn't have been anyone else.<br><br><i>How many times? he asked himself. How many times have I sacrificed my own honor to protect the unworthy? And how many times will I have to do it again?</i><br><br>"It's supposed to be fairly hot today," came a voice from behind him.<br><br>Sighing, Worf turned around. Another part of the routine: his aide, Giancarlo Wu, would enter the office and make some offhand comment about the weather, thus signaling the start of the workday. Wearing his usual monochrome shirt, matching pants, and different-colored vest -- today he went for red and green -- Wu stood in the doorway to the office, reaching into the vest's pocket.<br><br>However, he did not pull out his padd, as Worf had expected -- that padd was always either in Wu's hand or in his vest pocket, to the point that the ambassador honestly believed that his aide would suffer withdrawal symptoms if separated from it for any length of time. Instead, Wu removed an optical chip and walked it over to where Worf sat at his desk. "I think you'll want to see this first thing, sir. It was sent to you on a secure channel by T'Latrek."<br><br>After regarding the chip for a moment, Worf plugged it into the slot on the side of his terminal. Besides representing Vulcan on the Federation Council, T'Latrek served as the councillor for external affairs and was, in essence, Worf's superior.<br><br>The screen lit up with the logo of the Federation News Service. <i>Odd,</i> Worf thought. <i>Why would T'Latrek send me a news story?</i><br><br>A female Pandrilite face replaced the logo. <i>"The top story is the surprise resignation of Federation President Min Zife. In a move that has shocked the entire quadrant, President Zife, his chief of staff, Koll Azernal, and Nelino Quafina, the secretary of military intelligence, have stepped down from office, effective immediately. This statement was issued across the Federation this morning."</i><br><br>The image then cut to Zife sitting at his desk in the presidential office in Paris, his arms placed in front of him, resting on the large desk, which was currently empty of anything save the Bolian's blue-skinned hands. The flag of the Federation hung on a pole behind the president, in front of the huge window that provided a panorama of the City of Light that made Worf's own view of the First City pale in comparison. The Tour Eiffel was the only landmark in sight.<br><br><i>"It is with a sense of both regret and joy that I announce my resignation as president of the United Federation of Planets, as well as the resignation of Koll Azernal, my chief of staff, and Nelino Quafina, my military intelligence secretary. Regret because achieving this office has been the culmination of a lifetime of service to the Federation, and one that has been incredibly rewarding for myself and, I hope, for the Federation, particularly during the dark days of our war against the Dominion.<br><br>"Joy because I feel that this resignation is perhaps the greatest of those services that I can now give to the Federation. While my chief of staff and I were able to serve our nation well in war, we were, it seems, less suited for peace. As the war grows more distant in our past, it has become increasingly obvious that Koll and I need to step down for the good of the Federation. The model by which we survived during the war, and even during the first few months afterward, is no longer tenable as we and our allies attempt to bring a new era of peace.<br><br>"One of the truisms of sentient life throughout the galaxy is that different leadership is required for different circumstances.

What most forget is that when Alnat became the greatest power on Bolarus, and all her enemies were defeated, Vaq was forced to abdicate, for without an enemy to fight, she led the nation to economic ruin.<br><br>"Unlike Vaq, I will not wait for a coup d'�tat to remove me from power. I was given a mandate from the people of the Federation -- not once, but twice -- to lead them through uneasy times, to make quick and difficult decisions for the greater good. Now, though, serving that mandate has proven more problematic. Quick and difficult decisions are not what is best for the Federation, nor for our allies. The time has come when I can best serve the people's mandate by stepping down, by allowing the people to choose someone who can lead us in peace as effectively as I was able to in war.<br><br>"As per the Federation charter, an election will be held within the month. The Federation Council will continue to administrate on a pro tem basis until a new president has been elected.<br><br>"I thank you all very much for your support, your patience, and your understanding. Good-bye."</i><br><br>Back to the Pandrilite: <i>"The Federation Council made no comment regarding the resignations, but did release a statement: Councillor Ra'ch B'ullhy has been appointed president pro tempore, and the Council will be accepting petitions for presidential candidates immediately. The ballot containing the names of those who fit the criteria for candidacy will be announced by the Council one week from today. The election will be held at the end of the month.<br><br>"At present, the front-runners for presidential candidacy include T'Latrek of Vulcan, the current councillor for external affairs, who has held that position for eight decades; Nan Bacco, the planetary governor of Cestus III; Fel Pagro, the chief special emissary for Ktar; and Admiral William Ross of Starfleet. Naturally, speculation is already running rampant as to what led President Zife and Chief of Staff Azernal to their decision at this particular juncture, especially with the next election less than a year away."</i><br><br>The screen reverted to the FNS logo, then went blank.<br><br>Worf leaned back in his large leather chair. "A -- convincing fabrication."<br><br>"Sir?"<br><br>"Zife and Azernal's reasons for resigning begin and end with Tezwa."<br><br>"I suspected as much, sir. Still, the general public can't very well be aware of that, can they?"<br><br>Worf folded his arms. "No. This willing resignation is a far more palatable solution than admitting to secretly arming the Tezwans." If Martok or the Klingon High Council ever found out that the Federation president armed an enemy of the empire, it could lead to yet another abrogation of the Khitomer Accords, and possibly war between the Federation and the empire. Neither nation was in a position to wage a prolonged war against the other, and the collapse of their alliance would destabilize the Alpha Quadrant at a time when it could ill afford such a thing.<br><br><i>Yet another secret I must keep from a man I have called brother,</i> Worf thought bitterly. "I sometimes regret the day I chose to enter the realm of politics," he muttered.<br><br>Wu tilted his head. "I should think that after all these years, sir, you'd be used to it."<br><br>Glowering at his aide, Worf said, "The time since I accepted the ambassadorship is hardly 'all these years.' "<br><br>"My apologies, sir, I thought you said you regretted entering the realm of politics. That happened when you entered the Great Hall thirteen years ago in order to defend your father against accusations that he aided the Romulans at Khitomer."<br><br>Worf's glower intensified. "Excuse me?"<br><br>Wu put his hands in his vest pockets. "You accepted discommendation in order to cover up the crimes of the House of Duras and preserve unity on the High Council, but kept your brother -- a high-ranking officer in the Defense Force -- shielded from the dishonor. When Gowron needed help during the civil war, you were then able to use Kurn's position to restore your House and keep House Duras from gaining power." He removed his hands from his pockets, taking the padd out with his right hand. "Each of the last two chancellors, not to mention the emperor himself, owe their positions directly to you. You've probably had more impact on the face of Klingon politics than any single person in the last twenty years. Your accepting the ambassadorship was simply the continuation of a process you'd begun long before."<br><br>The aide's words mirrored similar ones spoken to Worf by Ambassador Spock three years earlier on a shuttle trip to a diplomatic conference. He had dismissed them then as exaggeration. He was tempted to do so now, but hesitated. Neither Spock nor Wu were prone to such things. Indeed, Wu had always, at Worf's own insistence, been completely honest with the ambassador.<br><br>"This -- analysis is your interpretation of what I have done over the years?" he finally asked.<br><br>Wu shrugged. "Not really -- simply the facts as I and many others see them. I had always assumed that it was why you were given this position in the first place. You've always been an excellent politician, sir."<br><br>Although he had worked on Qo'noS and among Klingons for over a decade, Wu was still a human. For that reason alone, Worf let the insult pass. That, and he'd never find an aide as talented.<br><br>As was Wu's wont, he noticed that Worf was not pleased with the way the conversation was turning, and so stared down at his padd and changed the subject. "There was a personal message accompanying T'Latrek's transmission, sir. She wishes to assure you that she has no intention of running for president, any more than she has the other dozen times an election has occurred since she joined the Federation Council, and also that she will contact you with further instructions on how to present this new information to the High Council within the hour. This is useful, as the council has requested your presence in the Great Hall at high sun."<br><br>"Naturally." Worf felt a growl build in his throat, but he tamped it down.<br><br>"I took the liberty of clearing all your appointments for today, save one, so you would be free to speak to T'Latrek and the council. I assume that that particular business will preclude all others."<br><br>Worf rose from his chair. "You assume correctly." He started to pace the room, walking toward the window. "What is the appointment you did not clear?"<br><br>At this, Wu smiled. "The <i>Ya'Vang</i> was recalled to Qo'noS for maintenance yesterday, and its crew granted shore leave. Your son will be here in twenty minutes."<br><br>Once, Worf might have greeted that news with apprehension, even anger. Alexander was born to K'Ehleyr, Worf's first love. When K'Ehleyr was slain by Duras on the <i>Enterprise-</i>D, Worf had avenged her death in the proper manner, and also taken responsibility for their son. Alexander was raised alternately by Worf on the Enterprise and by Worf's human foster parents on Earth; neither solution proved tenable. Sergey and Helena Rozhenko did the best they could, but they were too old to raise yet another child, and Worf was simply unsuited to the role of father.<br><br>It was the Dominion War that gave Alexander purpose. He enlisted in the Defense Force, serving on several ships during the conflict. Though the youth would never be mistaken for a great warrior, he did eventually grow into a decent soldier.<br><br>In the years since the war, father and son had come to a certain peace, for which Worf was grateful. His failures with Alexander had always gnawed at him, made him feel as if he had betrayed K'Ehleyr in some way. She deserved better than that -- as did their child. To make matters worse, the <i>Ya'Vang</i> had been at the forefront of the fleet that the Defense Force had sent <br><br>to Tezwa. Though Worf's actions in stopping the fleet were primarily committed in order to preserve the peace and save Klingon lives, that he was able to rescue his son from a pointless death was never far from his thoughts.<br><br>The intercom on Worf's desk beeped. The voice of Damir Gorjanc, one of the embassy staff, spoke: <i>"Sir, you have a coded message from Earth."</i><br><br>"That," Wu said, "will no doubt be T'Latrek."<br><br>"No doubt." To Gorjanc, Worf said, "Put it through."<br><br>Expecting the Vulcanoid features of T'Latrek, Worf was surprised to instead see the teal-hued face and horned head of another member of the Federation Council, one Worf had first met almost a decade earlier.<br><br>"Councillor Ra'ch. It is good to see you again."<br><br><i>"Likewise, Mr. Ambassador."</i> Ra'ch B'ullhy, the former governor of Damiano, smiled. <i>"We've both come a long way since you saved my life at my inauguration."</i> Worf, then security chief of the <i>Enterprise,</i> had prevented an assassination attempt on Ra'ch's life when she took office. <i>"You're an ambassador, and I'm the president pro tem."</i><br><br>"Congratulations."<br><br>Ra'ch's face went sour. <i>"Easy for you to say -- you're safe on Qo'noS. Believe me, I didn't want this. But since I'm stuck with the responsibility, I wanted to let you know how this needs to be presented to the High Council."</i><br><br>Worf wondered if this was why Ra'ch rather than T'Latrek was making the call. While the notion that Vulcans never lied, much like the notion that Klingons never did, was more ideal than reality, that didn't change the fact that most Vulcans were uncomfortable with falsehood.<br><br>"I assume," he said dryly, "that the truth is to be avoided at all costs."<br><br><i>"Good assumption. As far as Chancellor Martok is concerned, this is a decision that both Zife and Azernal have been contemplating for quite a while, and they felt that the time was right to make the announcement."</i><br><br>"And if they ask why there were no indications of this -- contemplation prior to now?"<br><i><br>"The fact that the president and his primary aide are about to resign is hardly something they want to spread around. The tightest possible security was kept ...</i></p><h2>Chris Killip (55 Series)</h2><p>This volume - investigating the work of a particular photographer, in this case, Chris Killip - comprises a 4000-word essay by an expert in the field, 55 photographs presented chronologically, each with a commentary, and a biography of the featured photographer.</p><p>Badger is a photographer, architect and curator.

He had no home, and he could not support the illegitimate child he had fathered during an impetuous love affair in France. The major part of a slim, anonymously issued volume of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> was all he had to show for the years since he had left Cambridge, and yet he was convinced that he was called to be a major poet. Recognition came slowly, but by age 70 he was revered as a cultural icon, the Poet Laureate of England, and the most celebrated native of the Lake Country, where he was visited by royalty and many of the great poets of his day. <br> Based on an intimate knowledge of the poet's manuscripts, on a fresh look at contemporary records, and a careful analysis of the vast amount of research that has appeared in the last two decades, this vividly written volume is the first serious biography of Wordsworth to appear in over twenty-five years. Stephen Gill, a leading authority on Wordsworth's work, reveals that in many ways this giant of English literature lead a heroic life. Persisting against critical condemnation, numbing blows from the death of friends and family, including three of his own children, and his inability to make enough money from his writings to support himself, his dedication to his art did not waver. Moreover, Gill corrects the image of the older Wordsworth as a stodgy betrayer of his radical youth. While his politics certainly did change, and his poetic power waned, from 1799 almost to his death in 1850, Wordsworth single-mindedly shaped his own life in submission to an imaginative possession whose importance he never doubted. <br> Illustrated with over twenty halftones--including portraits, manuscript pages, and places important to Wordsworth and his family--this is an authoritative account of one of literature's great innovators, a writer who permanently enlarged the range of English poetry, both in subject matter and in treatment, and left a body of work that has enjoyed an enormous and lasting popularity. Providing considerable insight into Wordsworth's poetic achievement, Gill illuminates what was most essential to Wordsworth himself: his life as a writer.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br><strong>Stephen Gill</strong> is Fellow and Tutor of Lincoln College, Oxford University.

As well as being a retrospective of his work, it is a cultural journey through a time when rock ruled. It is a compendium of experiences, eyewitness accounts, and intimate detail, all culminating in candid incidental visual insights and time-tested iconic imagery that we all recognize today.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is a vivid and memorable account of Rock's adventures behind the camera, a colorful blend of the overt and the intimate, the beautiful, and the irreverent truly exposed.</p><p><b>Mick Rock's</b> career was launched when he photographed an almost unknown David Bowie in 1972. The two established an instant rapport and Rock went on to direct several of his music videos. His reputation as "the man who shot the 70s" was cemented with iconic images of Lou Reed, Syd Barrett, Iggy Pop, Queen, the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, and Blondie.

He and his wife live in the Boston area." 0738206342 "A graduate of Harvard Medical School, <b>Dr. Henry Lerner</b> has been an obstetrician/gynecologist for twenty-two years. He lives in Newton, Massachusetts. Contributor <b>Alice Domar, Ph.D.</b> is a nationally-recognized authority on emotional and psychological issues in women's reproduction and is a pioneer in the field of mind-body medicine."There's something about a good baseball yarn that brings out a writer's childlike enthusiasm; in this case, Adelman's gusto makes this account of the legendary 1975 World Series between the Cincinnati Reds and the Boston Red Sox at once a joy and a bit of a pain to read. Adelman's retelling of one of baseball's greatest showdowns goes in so many different directions that the reader is sometimes hard put to relax and enjoy it; skipping between teams, players and games with the ferocity of a suicide squeeze, Adelman jumps from Casey Stengel to Steve Garvey with a story about a missed steal sign thrown by Don Zimmer as a segue. He tosses in bits about players' personal lives, too-Johnny Bench's rocky marriage to an Ultra Brite model; Mickey Mantle's nightmares; Luis Tiant's longing for his family in Cuba-for added color. And he still manages to depict in gripping detail the split-second decisions of legends like Pete Rose, Sparky Anderson, the elder Bonds and Griffey, Billy Martin, Johnny Bench and Yaz-uncovering some great inside stories and little-known anecdotes along the way. Also, 1975 was the year free agency came to baseball, when Catfish Hunter challenged the indentured servitude practiced by the owners and won, later becoming the game's first free agent and signing with (who else?) the Yankees. It signaled the end of the era of players being contractually bound to one team and ushered in the high-priced bidding wars that are now the hallmark of the sport. While Adelman doesn't explore the advent of free agency nearly as much as he could, choosing instead to analyze pitching decisions and the positioning of the second baseman on a hopper up the middle, he's still written a thoroughly enjoyable baseball book. 16 pages b&amp;w photos <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bedford Boys : One Small Town&#39;s Ultimate D-Day Sacrifice</h2><p>The memorable opening scene of &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34;, which portrayed the appalling scenario on Omaha Beach, where allied bombs had failed to knock out German gun emplacements or do any damage whatsoever to beach defences was loosely based on Bedford&#39;s story. The first wave of seasick young GIs were being tipped out into the tide to be picked off by waiting machine gun fire and shelling, acting more as target practice than a tangible threat. Incredible bravery and luck did in some instances prevail, and with the help of a more successful bomibing campaign later in the day, Omaha was finally taken. Company A was in that first wave of landings - known, jokingly as &#34;the suicide wave&#34; by soliders before the attack. Many of Bedford&#39;s young recruits to the US Army found themselves training and fighting together in Company A of the 116th Regiment of the 29th Division - a company which was all but obliterated by the end of the Longest Day. From small town lives - wives, fiancees and childhoods - to training in the UK and those fateful D-Day landings on on to the aftermath, this book creates a vivid portrait of one town&#39;s loss.</p><p>Alex Kershaw is a British journalist and screenwriter.

In a fertile user's manual to the mind, de Bono, a prolific author and business consultant, tackles creative thought as a skill that can be taught, a systematic process of breaking free of old concepts and finding alternatives. In an informal, discursive style, he presents an arsenal of techniques for cultivating ideas and harvesting the usable onesto avoid mixed metaphor; also, harvest is late stage of agricultural process, so should come after 'nurture' or 'cultivation' . Rooted in his theory that creativity flows out of the way human perception works as a self-organizing information system, these techniques include random word generation, multiple focuses, "provocations" that provide a novel framework through which to look at things, and the "six hats method" encouraging cooperative exploration instead of adversarial thinking. His insights seem broadly applicable to business, education, law and other fields. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Going Nucular: Language, Politics and Culture in Confrontational Times</h2><p>Nunberg (linguistics, Stanford U.) does not spend much time on the romance of words or decrying the state of the language, but more often takes language as a jumping off point to see what words can reveal about other things, among them culture, war, politics, symbols, media, business, and technology. Many of the 65 essays began life as articles or radio commentaries. Annotation �2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Geoffrey Nunberg can make one quite self conscious to write even a simple sentence. And yes, that is a compliment. A regular language commentator on NPR's <i>Fresh Air</i>, Nunberg examines the curious ways in which the modern language expresses far more about history, politics, and culture than most casual English users would ever realize. <i>Going Nucular</i>, besides having one of the more whimsical titles to come along in a while, offers up scores of chapters, each examining specific words, phrases, or verbal tendencies. And while words like "terrorism", "fascism", "appeasement", and "Caucasian" (and even the hapless "like" and "ain't") are tossed about regularly in contemporary usage, achieving an understanding of their origin and evolution can serve to better explain not just the word but the issue to which it is attached. Other language books have become popular among the "grammarati" for their hard line approach but Nunberg seeks to explore and understand rather than to enforce and punish. To that end, he defends "blog" as being a verb and noun that has earned its place in the language; it's very phonetic clunkiness being part of the appeal. And though he can diagram a sentence with the best of them, Nunberg is at his most delightful when shining a harsh lingual light on the ways in which the average person encounters words every day. A stinging and hilarious indictment of TV news' weird obsession with the present tense ("In North Dakota, high winds making life difficult") makes the reader hear the evening news in an entirely new way. <i>Going Nucular</i> is much more than a nudge and a wisecrack to self-appointed word cops, it's an insider's tour of the vernacular by the English teacher you only wish you had. <i>--John Moe</i>Geoffrey Nunberg is a senior researcher at the Center for the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University and a Consulting Full Professor of Linguistics at Stanford University.

Now John Sayles has written his first short story collection in twenty-five years. The keynote story&#x2014;"Dillinger in Hollywood"&#x2014;is populated by leftovers from the Golden Age of Hollywood who live in a nursing home catering for "below-the-line" talent&#x2014;dancers, stunt doubles, horse wranglers, stand-ins, studio drivers&#x2014;who now wait for death and dementia, playing cards, breaking hips, busting ribs, and telling tall tales of days gone by. During one hot summer, Casey, a long-term resident, confesses that he "used to be John Dillinger. In the flesh." The supposed John Dillinger, a legendary outlaw who had been popped at the Biograph Theater, was simply a "stand-in." Sayles's stories, like his movies, are panoramic in scope, weaving together disparate elements, where the past has a powerful claim on the present, where the characters are down on their luck, struggling to make ends meet. Ultimately, John Dillinger in Hollywood showcases Sayles's uncanny ear for language, his skill at crafting character, humor and atmosphere, and shows why he is the winner of the John Steinbeck Award, the O. Henry Award, and others.</p><p>If the U.S. were to boast one great independent film director, he would be <b>John Sayles</b>, a cult figure among his admirers. Nominated for both an Academy Award for scriptwriting and a National Book Award, Sayles has written screenplays, teleplays, short stories, and novels and has worked as a script doctor for a virtual who's who of Hollywood film and television talent.Though Sayles is best known as the writer/director of acclaimed independent films (<i>Lone Star</i>; <i>Matewan</i>), he's also an accomplished novelist (<i>Union Dues</i>; <i>Los Gusanos</i>). In this engaging collection, his first in 25 years, he reminds us of his skill in shorter forms. In the title story, Son Bishop, an ex-horse wrangler and stunt man, works at a nursing home populated by the relics of Hollywood's Golden Age, one of whom claims he "<i>used</i> to be" John Dillinger. "Your geriatrics and horses hold a lot in common," Bishop muses. "[T]hey're high-strung, they bite and kick sometimes, and they're none of them too big on bowel control." The more substantial and subtle "Casa de Los Babys" (the genesis of his eponymous movie?) follows a group of American women waiting to adopt babies in a Latin American city, as well as a maid at their crumbling hotel, a nurse at the orphanage and a young homeless boy who would like nothing better than to nab the women's wallets. "The Halfway Diner" finds a company of women riding a weekly bus to visit their husbands in jail and touchingly describes their esprit de corps ("The thing is," the narrator says, "we're all of us doing time"). Humor leavens the social conscience in many of these tales, and Sayles's exceptional dialogue is reason enough to appreciate this collection. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Conflict and violence are sustained by the illusion of a unique identity, overlooking the need for reason and choice in deciding on bonds of class, gender, profession, scientific interests, moral beliefs, and even our shared identity as human beings. Challenging the reductionist view that people of the world can be partitioned into little boxes in terms of civilizational categories, Sen draws on history, economics, science, literature, and his own memories of difficult as well as easy times on three continents to present an inspiring vision of a world that can be made to move toward peace as firmly as it has spiraled in recent years toward violence and war.<br><br><b>About the series: Issues of Our Time</b>: "Aware of the competition for the attention of readers, W.

Norton &amp; Company and I have created the "Issues of Our Time" as a lucid series of highly readable books through which some of today's most thoughtful intellectuals seek to challenge the general reader to reexamine received truths and grapple with powerful trends that are shaping the world in which we live. The series launches with Anthony Appiah, Alan Dershowitz, and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen as the first of an illustrious group who will tackle some of the most plangent and central issues defining our society today through books that deal with such issues as sexual and racial identities, the economics of the developing world, and the concept of citizenship in a truly globalized twenty-first-century world culture. Above all else, these books are designed to be read and enjoyed."&#x2014;Henry Louis Gates Jr., W. E. B. DuBois Professor of the Humanities, Harvard University</p><p><b>Amartya Sen</b> has written several books including <i>Development as Freedom</i> and <i>The Argumentative Indian</i>. He won the 1998 Nobel Prize in economics. A professor at Harvard University, he lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Cambridge, England.Nowadays the economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen travels the world, opinions at the ready. His subjects are rarely economic. In the main, he works "out of area," taking on a wide range of political and social issues that have little to do with the dismal science. He is serene and confident, full of good cheer, ready to see the best in everyone.<p> Over this discursive little book lies the shadow of Sen's formidable Harvard colleague, the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, with his celebrated theory of the "clash of civilizations." Sen has assigned himself the role of the anti-Huntington: Sen sees Huntington's thesis of cultural conflict yielding a one-dimensional approach to human identity -- and leading to the "civilizational and religious partitioning of the world," which can only occasion greater global disorder. </p><p>ere, in contrast, is Sen celebrating the complexity of human identity: "The same person can be, without any contradiction, an American citizen, of Caribbean origin, with African ancestry, a Christian, a liberal, a woman, a vegetarian, a long-distance runner, a historian, a schoolteacher, a novelist, a feminist, a heterosexual, a believer in gay and lesbian rights, a theater lover, an environmental activist, a tennis fan, a jazz musician," etc. One's civilizational identity is not one's destiny, Sen observes, and civilizational "partitioning" -- seeing the planet culture by culture -- does not capture the messiness of the world. This Earth of ours, he says, is made more "flammable" by warring definitions of human identity, rather than an embrace of the many different facets that make us human. </p><p>Sen's faith in the multiplicity of claims on human loyalty is admirable, but it can hardly stand up to the fury of the true believers. In our combustible world today, Huntington's outlook has much greater power. His "cartography" of civilizations may have been too sharply drawn and he may have been a bit cavalier about modernity's appeal across cultural lines, but he came forth with a formidable work. Nor did he fail to see the fissures at the heart of particular societies -- hence his category of "torn countries," places like Turkey, Russia and Mexico, where the matter of loyalty and identity is fiercely contested. But Sen needs his straw man, and Huntington is pressed into the role.</p><p> Sen is a product of Western (British) education. But he sees no clear demarcation between the West and the rest (the language is Huntington's). There is nothing peculiarly Western about democracy, Sen argues. It has global roots; there were antecedents of it in India and in the Muslim world at about the same time when "Inquisitions were quite extensive in Europe, and heretics were still being burned at the stake." In his most intensely argued assertion, Sen sees the democratic inheritance as a truly universal enterprise. "The Western world has no proprietary right over democratic ideas," he writes. "While modern institutional forms of democracy are relatively new everywhere, the history of democracy in the form of public participation and reasoning is spread across the world." Western practice was not "sequestered" then, and it has not developed in some "splendid isolation." </p><p> It is the unease of Islam, of course, and the violence of some of its radical adherents that have given the question of identity its contemporary global relevance. On that issue Huntington was at his most prophetic, writing of Islam's "bloody borders" and of the "youth bulge" in Muslim societies that had unhinged and radicalized the Muslim world. He did so in the early 1990s, and then history -- 9/11 and all that followed -- provided his thesis with cruel compliance. </p><p>Sen, however, wishes to rescue Islam from this "confinement." He makes his way through Islam's history and its wide geographic sweep in order to find great Muslim practitioners of tolerance and periods of genuine enlightenment. There is Akbar, the great Mughal emperor, who "insisted in the 1590s on the need for open dialogue and free choice, and also arranged recurrent discussions involving not only mainstream Muslim and Hindu thinkers, but also Christians, Jews, Parsees, Jains, and even atheists." In the face of the anti-Semitic bigotry of today's radical Islamism, Sen offers the example of Muslim rule in C�rdoba and the Iberian Peninsula -- that time of convivencia, where a Judeo-Islamic civilization in court life, letters and philosophy had a genuine flowering. </p><p> Sen works with the anecdote: His potted history is tailored for interfaith dialogues. He writes of the great Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who, when forced to emigrate from "an intolerant Europe" in the 12th century, was able to find "a tolerant refuge in the Arab world" in the court of the great Muslim ruler Saladin. But this will not do as history. Maimonides, born in 1135, did not flee "Europe" for the "Arab world": He fled his native C�rdoba in Spain, which was then in the grip of religious-political terror, choking under the yoke of a Berber Muslim dynasty, the Almohads, that was to snuff out all that remained of the culture of convivencia and made the life of Spain's Jews (and of the free spirits among its Muslims) utter hell. Maimonides and his family fled the fire of the Muslim city-states in the Iberian Peninsula to Morocco and then to Jerusalem. There was darkness and terror in Morocco as well, and Jerusalem was equally inhospitable in the time of the Crusader Kingdom. Deliverance came only in Cairo -- the exception, not the rule, its social peace maintained by the enlightened Saladin. </p><p>Here, for Sen's benefit, is a passage from Maimonides's seminal Epistle to Yemen: "Our hearts are weakened, our minds are confused, and our strength wanes because of the dire misfortunes that have come upon us in the form of religious persecution in the two ends of the world, the East and the West." Maimonides's geography was Islamic: The East in the Epistle was Yemen, then a battleground between Sunni and Shiite Islam, a place where Jews were being subjected to forced conversions to Islam; the Western lands were the burning grounds of Andalusia. The Almohads' pitiless warriors were in every way the Taliban of their age, the ancestors of today's religious radicals in the world of Islam. They put to the sword the fabled world of Andalusian tolerance, and young Maimonides witnessed the shattering collapse of that culture. There had been Andalusian bliss, and Muslim rulers with Jewish courtiers and poets, and philosophers who believed in the primacy of reason, but that world was scorched. </p><p>Inspirational history can go only so far; it will not bend to Sen's good cheer.</p><p>Reviewed by Fouad Ajami <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

The outcome is in doubt and a terrible blow has fallen on American morale. Lieutenant David Armistead, a Marine Corps hero and cousin of the President of the United States, is missing and some say he's gone over to the enemy. Coast Guard Captain Josh Thurlow and his ragtag crew are given the assignment to find Armistead, though not necessarily to bring him back alive. Recruited in the hunt is a tormented and frail PT-boat skipper nicknamed "Shafty" who is also known by another name: John F. Kennedy. When Josh is stranded in the jungles of New Georgia with a mysterious, sensual woman who has a tendency to chop off men's heads, it's up to Kennedy to come to the rescue and complete the mission. But to procure a gunboat, he first has to play high-stakes poker with a young naval supply officer called Nick who happens to be the best gambler in the South Pacific. Nick has another name, too: Richard M. Nixon.

As the fate of the South Pacific hangs precariously in the balance, Lieutenant David Armistead--a Marine Corps hero and cousin of President Franklin Roosevelt--is rumored to have deserted, perhaps to the enemy. For Coast Guard Commander Josh Thurlow, the news is particularly bad. He befriended Armistead while fighting by his side. Now he has orders straight from the top to bring him back or kill him in the attempt.<br><br>Pressed into the mission is an officer who couldn't be less like Josh: a shiftless PT boat skipper named John F. Kennedy. To find their elusive quarry, they and Josh's crew of misfits must face dangers as exotic as the lush battleground that surrounds them, including implacable Japanese, an Australian coastwatcher-turned-warlord, and a beautiful seductress who will either steal Josh's heart--or have his head...<br><br>"WWII storytelling at its best."--James Bradley, author of <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i> and <i>Flyboys</i> <br>"Great war novels are often great adventure novels, too, and...<i>The Ambassador's Son</i> qualifies on both counts."<br>--James Reasoner, author of The Last Good War series<br>Homer Hickam is the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller <i>Rocket Boys</i> which was made into the acclaimed movie, "October Sky."

MICHAEL WILLIAMSON is a photographer for the Washington Post who, in addition to the Pulitzer Prize he shares with Maharidge, won a second Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the war in Kosovo. His other honors include the World Press Photo and Nikon World Understanding Through Photography awards.The collaborative effort of photographer Walker Evans and writer James Agee, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, portrayed the lives of three sharecropper families in the South during the Depression, giving witness to the tyranny of the tenant farming system that enslaved some nine million tenants in 1936. Their book was at once poetic, scathing, compelling, and tragic. Fifty years later, Maharidge and Williamson have revisited, photographed, and interviewed the surviving members and descendants of the Gudger, Ricketts, and Woods families shown in that book. There are so many lives in this saga that it is difficult to keep everyone straight, and the many stories of hardship caused by cotton and the struggle to leave it behind feel less like document than fiction.

We are on the threshold, say authors Pine and Gilmore, of the Experience Economy, a new economic era in which all businesses must orchestrate memorable events for their customers. The Experience Economy offers a creative, highly original, and yet eminently practical strategy for companies to script and stage the experiences that will transform the value of what they produce. From America Online to Walt Disney, the authors draw from a rich and varied mix of examples that showcase businesses in the midst of creating personal experiences for both consumers and businesses. The authors urge managers to look beyond traditional pricing factors like time and cost, and consider charging for the value of the transformation that an experience offers. Goods and services, say Pine and Gilmore, are no longer enough. Experiences and transformations are the basis for future economic growth, and The Experience Economy is the script from which managers can begin to direct their own transformations.</p><p>Sometime during the last 30 years, the service economy emerged as the dominant engine of economic activity. At first, critics who were uncomfortable with the intangible nature of services bemoaned the decline of the goods-based economy, which, thanks to many factors, had increasingly become commoditized. Successful companies, such as Nordstrom, Starbucks, Saturn, and IBM, discovered that the best way to differentiate one product from another--clothes, food, cars, computers--was to add service.<p> But, according to Joseph Pine and James Gilmore, the bar of economic offerings is being raised again. In <i>The Experience Economy</i>, the authors argue that the service economy is about to be superseded with something that critics will find even more ephemeral (and controversial) than services ever were: <i>experiences</i>. In part because of technology and the increasing expectations of consumers, services today are starting to look like commodities. The authors write that "Those businesses that relegate themselves to the diminishing world of goods and services will be rendered irrelevant. To avoid this fate, you must learn to stage a rich, compelling experience."</p><p> Many will find the idea of staging experiences as a requirement for business survival far-fetched. However, the authors make a compelling case, and consider successful companies that are already packaging their offerings as experiences, from Disney to AOL. Far-reaching and thought-provoking, <i>The Experience Economy</i> is for marketing professionals and anyone looking to gain a fresh perspective on what business landscape might look like in the years to come.

This book by Brian Kennedy, Director of the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College, includes interviews with the artist about his career and, in particular, his preoccupation with stripes, as well as essays on the stripe in Western abstract painting and in Sean Scully&#39;s work of the past four decades. Scully, described as &#34;the modern-day savior of abstract art&#34; by the Wall Street Journal, is one of the most esteemed abstract painters working today, and the stripe is the key motif in his works. Scully is known for painting bold patterns of vertical, horizontal, and occasionally diagonal stripes in blocks of layered color as a means of exploring the nature of human relationships. He is inspired by aspects of everyday life, from the constructed grids of skyscrapers, strung-out suburbs, railway lines, motorways, and telephone lines to airplane routes, walls, and garage doors. Scully&#39;s pursuit of multiple variations on the theme of the painted stripe, bar, and block is consistent with his assertion that &#34;the stripe is a signifier of modernism.&#34; In earlier centuries stripes were used to separate outsiders from the rest of society. In the nineteenth century, artists began to adopt the stripe as a symbol of their status as bohemians, and in the early twentieth century, stripes became a mode of expression for many artists, including especially Piet Mondrian, Robert Motherwell, and Frank Stella. Today, the stripe is ubiquitous in society. Sean Scully has made stripes his own, developing through them a visual language based on a sustained examination of classical painting traditions. Art critic Arthur Danto comments on Scully&#39;s stripes, &#34;His edges have a tactile beauty. These stripes have a living quality.&#34;</p><p>BRIAN P.

Her books have earned spots on a handful of prestigious lists, such as Book Links&#34;AFew Good Books of the Year,&#34;Bank Street Best Books of the Year, and American Booksellers Pick of the Lists. Booklist has praised her stories as &#34;lyrically told...with cultural particulars woven gracefully into the text.&#34;Grade 1-3&#x2013;Lalibela is a mountain town in Ethiopia, known for its production of fine honey. Kessler's story features Almaz, a plucky girl who wishes to take on the traditionally male work of beekeeping. The men laugh when she can't climb a tall tree to fetch down a woven hive, except for Father Haile Kirros, who encourages her. In a few months, she returns to the marketplace, just as she had sworn to do, with very fine honey. Jenkins follows the ups and downs of Almaz's labor in deep-hued, mixed-media scenes spread richly across double pages. Focusing on the characters and their activities, the artist washes colors in broad layers for his background, sometimes adding chalky swirls resembling children's sidewalk drawings. Text blocks on some pages are simply set against the scene in white or black print, but other times they're set on irregular cream-colored shapes that almost appear to be speech balloons. Though the added elements are a bit cluttered, the art handsomely conveys the African setting. Kessler includes well-chosen details about the beekeeping project and a few words from the local Amharic and Tigringna languages. Easily understood in the text, they appear in a concluding glossary with an author's note on the village and its legendary name. Almaz's conclusion that Life is sweet is well earned, and readers will cheer her determination and good sense in realizing her dream.<i>&#x2013;Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Or as the Buddha once said, &#34;If you wish to know the divine, feel the wind on your face and the warm sun on your hand.&#34; Earth&#39;s Echo is a book for people who love nature and find spiritual meaning in it. Using brief excerpts from the work of nature writers as touchstones for meditation, the book leads the reader to reflect on the sacred reality of nature as found in different settings: the seashore, the river, the forest, the desert, and the mountain. It translates the traditional monastic practice of sacred reading, known as lectio divina, into an easily accessible four-step form: paying attention, pondering, responding, and surrendering.</p><p>Robert M. Hamma, the author of eight books including Landscapes of the Soul says Earth&#39;s Echo is for people who love nature and find spiritual meaning in it. He wrote Earth&#39;s Echo to &#34;provide a way to pay attention to the spiritual depths of nature.&#34; Hamma, who holds a master&#39;s in theology from the University of Notre Dame as well as a master&#39;s in divinity, currently serves as editorial director of Ave Maria Press and its imprint SORIN BOOKS. His last book, Through Good Times and Bad, a book of reflections on marriage, was co-written with his wife, Kathryn Schneider. They live with their three children in Granger, Indiana."For Robert Hamma all of nature--the seashore, the river, the forest, the desert, the mountains--is not just a metaphor for God but a form of divine presence. Earth's Echo is a sacred and awe-inspiring book that is indispensable reading for anyone on a spiritual journey."<br><br>"Thomas Merton defined monastic prayer as an "attentive, watchful listening of the heart."

Since then he has written more than 18 novels, the most recent of which is <em> The Fifth Witness</em>.</strong> <strong> </strong> <p></p> <p>You know how the song goes--&#x201c;If I can make it here, I&#x2019;ll make it anywhere.&#x201d; The anthem for a city and a state of mind, powered by the voice of its own son, Frank Sinatra, even if technically he came from across the river. <em>New York, New York</em>. It is truly the first song on the soundtrack of the city. And it points up the risk and reward of living in the greatest city in the world.</p> <p>Well, what about the risks and rewards in writing a novel about the greatest city in the world? To me the challenge would be intimidating, even daunting, before I got the first word down on the first page. But not to Alafair Burke. With <em>Long Gone</em> she makes the city her own. She takes New York with a knowing and confident hand, folding its teeming streets into character and plot in a story that is never less than gripping.</p> <p>At center you have Alice Humphrey. She is the daughter of privilege in a city that doesn&#x2019;t pay much mind to that privilege. She&#x2019;s on her own and that is the beating heart of this book. Alice on her own. Burke constructs this book with the precision of a watchmaker. It is a contraption piece that closes tightly around Alice and then we are with her as she investigates the set up and finds her way to safety.</p> <p>I am familiar with most of Burke&#x2019;s work and I think Alice is her best heroine yet. She connects with us on so many levels. She is an everywoman cornered by forces she doesn&#x2019;t recognize or understand in a city with too many back alleys and secrets to ever know. She is from a family that holds secrets from her as well as the world. But no matter. She is relentless in her pursuit of the truth, whichever way it is finally told. And in that we connect to her, admire her, like her. We feel for Alice Humphrey and want to be there when she sees it all through.</p> <p>That is the writer&#x2019;s most difficult task, building the bridge of empathy between reader and protagonist. Burke does it here with a character who is persistent in simply refusing to be a victim. Don&#x2019;t we all wish we were the same.</p> <p>Though any writer will flat out tell you that the easier it looks the harder it is to get on the page, Alafair Burke makes this one look like a walk in the park. Frank Sinatra would certainly be proud. Start spreading the news.</p><p>What if everything you thought you knew turned out to be a lie?</p><p>After a layoff and months of struggling, Alice Humphrey finally lands her dream job managing a new art gallery in Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District.

A strong focus on technique embedded in the book through playful technique games, chants, and carefully-composed pieces that gently lead the child into pianistic motions. 2. An outstanding CD for the young student to listen, sing, tap, and play along with at the piano. The orchestrated songs on the CD feature children singing the lyrics, which has great appeal to the 5-6 year old beginner. The CD becomes a ready-made practice partner that guides the student and parent for all the pieces and activities in the books. 3. The fanciful art features five multi-cultural children who are also learning to play. These friends at the piano introduce basic rhythms, white key names, and a variety of white and black-key songs that span classical, folk, and blues. Young students will listen, sing, create, and play more musically with Nancy and Randall Faber s My First Piano Adventure, Lesson Book A. The Lesson Book introduces directional pre-reading, elementary music theory and technique with engaging songs, games, and creative discovery at the keyboard. Young students will enjoy the multi-cultural &#34;friends at the piano&#34; who introduce white-key names, basic rhythms, and a variety of songs which span classical, folk, and blues. Ear-training and eye-training are also part of the curriculum. The Fabers&#39; instructional theory &#34;ACE&#34; - Analysis, Creativity, and Expression, guides the pedagogy of My First Piano Adventure. Analysis leads to understanding, creativity leads to self-discovery, and expression develops personal artistry. The CD for this book offers a unique listening experience with outstanding orchestrations and vocals. The recordings demonstrate a key principle of the course: when children listen, sing, tap, and move to their piano music, they play more musically.</p><p></p><h2>Passport to Survival: Four Foods and More to Use and Store</h2><p>Passport to Survival is predominantly concerned with food preparation, preservation and storage with over 100 recipes.</p><p></p><h2>Fish (First Discovery Books)</h2><p>Extensive illustrations and clear text explain how fish from all over the world swim, eat, breathe, and live in the water, and include acetate pages that reveal the complex anatomy of a fish.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Brady</h2><p>A young Pennsylvania boy takes part in the pre-Civil War anti-slavery activities.</p><p>Acclaimed biographer, Jean Fritz, was born in China to American missionaries on November 16, 1915.

It ranks with the greatest books ever written in the English language. As a narrative of war and adventure . . . it is unsurpassable. Winston Churchill</p><p>This is the exciting and highly literate story of the real Lawrence of Arabia, as written by Lawrence himself, who helped unify Arab factions against the occupying Turkish army, circa World War I. Lawrence has a novelist&#39;s eye for detail, a poet&#39;s command of the language, an adventurer&#39;s heart, a soldier&#39;s great story, and his memory and intellect are at least as good as all those. Lawrence describes the famous guerrilla raids, and train bombings you know from the movie, but also tells of the Arab people and politics with great penetration. Moreover, he is witty, always aware of the ethical tightrope that the English walked in the Middle East and always willing to include himself in his own withering insight.The monumental work that assured T.E. Lawrence&#39;s place in history as &#34;Lawrence of Arabia.&#34; Not only a consummate military history, but also a colorful epic and a lyrical exploration of the mind of a great man who helped shape the Middle East as it exists today.</p><h2>Gin Glorious Gin: How Mother&#39;s Ruin Became the Spirit of London</h2><p><p><i>Gin Glorious Gin</i> is a vibrant cultural history of London seen through the prism of its most iconic drink.

While searching for a place to live and a temporary haven following the September 11th attacks, Manhattan journalist Wendy Bounds was delivered to Guinan's doorstep by a friend. And a visit that began with one beer turned into a life-changing encounter.</p><p>Captivated by the bar's charismatic but ailing owner, Bounds uprooted herself and moved to tiny Garrison. There she became one of the rare female regulars at the old pub and was quickly swept up by its motley characters and charms. What follows is a riveting journey as her fate, and that of Guinan's, unfolds. Told with sensitivity, humor and an unflinching eye, <em>Little Chapel on the River</em> is a love story about a place&#x2014;and the people who bring it to life.</p><p>Along Bounds's journey you'll meet the people of Guinan's: Jim Guinan himself, the stubborn high priest of this little chapel who spins rich tales of the town's robber barons, castles and mythological swans that feed at his front door; his grown children, whose duty to their father, and the town, have kept Guinan's up and running against immeasurable odds; Fitz, a tough-talking Vietnam vet who eventually takes the author under his wing; Tom Endres, who first rowed to the bar illegally as a cadet and who returned as a full-fledged colonel in the U.S Army; Walter, the kindhearted and neurotic next-door neighbor who torches dandelions with his lighter; and Lou-Lou, the overweight doe-eyed hound and the most faithful four-legged parishioner at the pub.</p><p>This beautifully written, deeply personal and brilliantly insightful book is as much about remembering to value the past as it is about learning to seize the present. Filled with stories of joy and sorrow, of universal family struggles with loyalty, love, betrayal and redemption, this work ultimately brims with hope as Bounds expertly captures a nostalgic slice of quintessential American life. And while chronicling the pub's fight to endure and her own search for a simpler way of life, she shares how and why the spirit moves those who come to worship in this little chapel on the river.</p></p><p><p>Gwendolyn (Wendy) Bounds is a writer and editor for <em>The Wall Street Journa</em>l, where she has worked since 1993. Bounds has written about culture, travel, technology, retail and fashion, and has also published several first-person pieces and columns about family for the newspaper. Her first-person essay "Amid the Ashes, Baby Carriages, Shoes, Family Photos," which she wrote with her partner Kathryn Kranhold, won the 2002 Front Page Award for September 11th commentary from the Newswoman&#x2019;s Club of New York.</p>Bounds and her partner lived across the street from the World Trade Center; they both wrote for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and were getting ready to go to work when the planes struck the towers on 9/11. They made their way to friends uptown, and in the following months, they parked themselves in a variety of temporary accommodations, as their building was uninhabitable. One friend brought them to Guinan's, an old Irish bar in the small, upper Hudson River town of Garrison, N.Y.&#x2014;and Bounds soon felt at home. She gradually let herself become enmeshed in the Guinan family saga, as well as in the intertwined tales of the regular customers. Before long, "the invisible red velvet rope" lifted, and she was helping out at the bar and setting up shop when the aging owner was hospitalized for diabetes-related surgery, buying a ramshackle home nearby and generally becoming included in the Guinan extended family. Bounds's story isn't flashy or dramatic; it's as low-key as her new, non-Manhattan friends. It modestly reminds us that in this uncertain world, when you come to a place that speaks to you, you should hold it dear and treasure it while it lasts. Photos. <i>Agent, David Black.

It&#39;s three main themes are particularly relevant to the present day. When scientific achievement, the welfare state, and dialectical materialism combine to make our century too worldly-minded, 1 Peter recalls us to the heavenly and eternal outlook, and reminds us we are but strangers and pilgrims here. Similarly, when relief from physical disease and the provision of physical comfort tend to be treated as the primary Christian objectives, we need the reminder that holiness matters more, and that all who would follow Christ must be prepared to suffer for righteousness&#39; sake, and to recognize that God uses suffering for the highest good. Also, when moral standards tend to decline, and when young converts are tempted to spend their enthusiasm more in words than in deeds, we need the challenge to express our response to the gospel in transformed behavior in relation to our fellow man.</p><p></p><h2>Plants of the Bible</h2><p>Discusses the role of plants and agriculture in biblical society and describes the various plants mentioned in the Old and New Testaments</p><p></p><h2>Short Dog: Cab Driver Stories from the L.

His articles and reviews have appeared in publications ranging from <i>Rolling Stone</i> to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. He is the former articles editor of <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> and op-ed editor of <i>New York Newsday</i>.Emerson (<i>Doo-Dah!: Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture</i>) enthusiastically chronicles the lives and careers of seven songwriting teams whose pioneering work from the late 1950s through the mid '60s ushered rock and roll into mainstream America. From Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, and Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman came enduring hits like "On Broadway" and "Yakety-Yak." Emerson follows their progress as competitors, lovers and collaborators, creating a hagiography of these ambitious, often classically trained (and often Brooklyn-bred) tyros, influenced as much by the great American songbook as New York City's Latin, soul and doo-wop sounds. Emerson also depicts a music industry in flux, shifting idols from Sinatra to Elvis and learning to cater to a lucrative youth market. Seldom short on gossip, this dense mix of biography, music analysis and social history offers an upbeat reading of rock history. It begs for a fuller discussion of the influences of Motown, the British invasion and payola, but Emerson's affectionate tone, delight in the songwriter's craft and extensive research are fortifying&#x2014;much like the classics he celebrates. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Walker, physician to the Pine Ridge Sioux from 1896 to 1914, are noted for the information they have yielded about Lakota life and culture. This third volume of previously unpublished material from the Walker collection presents his work with Lakota myth and legend. Three categories of literature are represented: tales that are classic examples of Lakota oral literature, narratives that were known only to a few Oglala holy men, and Walker's literary cycle representing his attempts to systematize all he had learned about Lakota myth.<p>In her extensive introduction, Elaine A. Jahner addresses the textual problems and critical questions posed by the material and assesses its place in Indian and in world literature. Of prime importance to students of comparative literature, religion, and mythology, <i>Lakota Myth</i> takes its place alongside <i>Lakota Belief and Ritual</i> (1980) and <i>Lakota Society</i> (1982), both available as Bison Books, as an indispensable source for Lakota traditions.</p></p><p></p><h2>Henry Kissinger and the American Century</h2><p><p> What made Henry Kissinger the kind of diplomat he was? What experiences and influences shaped his worldview and provided the framework for his approach to international relations? Jeremi Suri offers a thought-provoking, interpretive study of one of the most influential and controversial political figures of the twentieth century. </p><p> Drawing on research in more than six countries in addition to extensive interviews with Kissinger and others, Suri analyzes the sources of Kissinger's ideas and power and explains why he pursued the policies he did. Kissinger's German-Jewish background, fears of democratic weakness, belief in the primacy of the relationship between the United States and Europe, and faith in the indispensable role America plays in the world shaped his career and his foreign policy. Suri shows how Kissinger's early years in Weimar and Nazi Germany, his experiences in the U.S. Army and at Harvard University, and his relationships with powerful patrons--including Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon--shed new light on the policymaker. </p><p> Kissinger's career was a product of the global changes that made the American Century. He remains influential because his ideas are rooted so deeply in dominant assumptions about the world. In treating Kissinger fairly and critically as a historical figure, without polemical judgments, Suri provides critical context for this important figure. He illuminates the legacies of Kissinger's policies for the United States in the twenty-first century. </p></p><p>Jeremi Suri is E. Gordon Fox Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.Reviewed by David Greenberg<p>Perhaps because of the pungently Nixonian odor of the Bush White House -- the patriotism politics, the "l'�tat, c'est moi" declarations, the war -- this season has delivered a bounty of books about the men of Watergate. The current climate has vitalized anxieties about the imperial presidency, drawing fresh scrutiny to the Nixon years from such eminent writers as Robert Dallek, Elizabeth Drew, Margaret MacMillan, James Reston Jr., and Jules Witcover -- not to mention a Nixon biography from the scandal-plagued tycoon Conrad Black and the Broadway drama "Nixon/Frost."</p><p> Joining this lengthening queue is Jeremi Suri, a historian at the University of Wisconsin, with a useful, idiosyncratic study, Henry Kissinger and the American Century. Suri isn't trying to compete -- for audience or authoritativeness -- with Dallek's Nixon and Kissinger or MacMillan's Nixon and Mao, which combine scholarly rigor with popular appeal. Rather, he's gambling that less can be more. Suri's Kissinger is an academic rumination on the cerebral Harvard professor-turned-showboating national security adviser that, while intentionally narrow in scope, is bold in its reach.</p><p> With his gravelly Germanic mumble, horn-rimmed glasses, cold-blooded espousal of realpolitik, and a head that Oriana Fallaci likened to that of a sheep, Kissinger has become a most improbable American icon. Like his equally complex and controversial benefactor, Richard Nixon, he has generated reams of chitchat, psychobabble and lore, from his 383-page undergraduate thesis to his rumored liaisons with starlets. (One favorite tale: when thanked by an admirer for "saving the world," Kissinger replied: "You're welcome.") If only for his Strangelovean presence in American culture, he warrants explication.</p><p> Suri comes at Kissinger in two ways. In the book's first part, he explores Kissinger's formative experiences in their binational context -- the Bavarian Jew living under the Nazis, the immigrant in New York's Washington Heights, the army administrator returning to postwar Germany. In each trying situation, Kissinger learned to leverage his status as an outsider into influence -- a practice that soon became a Kissingerian trademark. In the book's second part, Suri puts forth a close reading of Kissinger's scholarship, finding in it elaborations of the distrust of popular passions first instilled in interwar Germany. In the two final chapters he highlights these traits within Nixon's international policies.</p><p> Some readers, it should be warned, may bristle at the author's undisguised admiration for his subject, particularly the words "brilliant," "genius" and "revolutionary," which pepper the prose. And Suri surprisingly omits discussion of Kissinger's well-known role in the original sin of Watergate -- the illegal wiretapping of journalists and White House aides -- and his alleged perjury in hushing it up.</p><p> By and large, however, Suri adopts the stance not of a partisan but of a sedate academic. History, after all, while not eschewing normative judgments altogether, calls for understanding more than moralizing -- not just for adjudicating the debates over Nixon's continuation of the Vietnam War and d�tente, but also for explaining the meaning of those debates. If the book doesn't damn Kissinger for the 1972 Christmas bombing of North Vietnam or the 1973 coup against Chile's Salvador Allende, it does try to show why he favored those actions.</p><p> The roots of Kissinger's ideas matter because for all his failures of policy and morality, he still elicits purring admiration from a certain insider set. The insiders love Henry because in foreign affairs, despite the proven importance of personal diplomacy, Americans crave overarching visions and "grand strategies" from which policy decisions are said to flow naturally. Kissinger managed to associate the age-old doctrine of realpolitik with his own person.</p><p> Of course, policymakers don't implement pure ideas. Individuals must interpret doctrine in light of new situations and through the filters of their own habits of mind. In Kissinger's case, his realism was animated by a cynicism so virulent that it ultimately devoured itself: Whereas more principled realists such as the political scientist Hans Morgenthau opposed the Vietnam War from early on, Kissinger (following Nixon's direction) suppressed hard-headed analyses warning that the conflict was unwinnable, preferring to chase the chimeras of credibility and reputation. More recently, Kissinger's covert advice to Bush to mimic Nixon's Vietnam course by standing fast in Iraq -- in opposition to realist perspectives -- suggests that a hunger for influence may again have trumped the logical conclusions of his own nominal worldview.</p><p> The underlying problem is that Kissinger never admitted a fatal contradiction in his peculiar brand of realism. As Suri notes, Kissinger was so disdainful of democratic accountability that he came to think that effective statecraft "depended on an almost mythical grand master" -- a philosopher-king, a professor in a Superman uniform -- whose brilliance and personality could hold it all together. Regarding his own era, Kissinger left no doubt about whom he considered that grand master to be.</p><p> In describing the legacy he wished to leave, Kissinger once said that he wanted to erect a lasting international framework that would reflect not his own preferences but the basic interests of the United States. Yet, ironically, his grand scheme required that it all rest on his personal touch.</p><p> As the years pass, the case for Kissinger's greatness becomes increasingly hard to sustain. His academic reputation has long since been deflated. Most scholars now agree that Nixon conceived and directed his own policy (except when incapacitated by Watergate), with Kissinger functioning as his agent. Even the perennial accusations of war crimes against Henry sound like overwrought sloganeering -- too lofty a charge to level at a mere deputy.</p><p> Kissinger is, in the end, a smart man -- not a genius, not even unusually brilliant -- whose lot it was to serve a president whose mania for acclaim, dreams of grandeur and taste for secrecy and deceit matched his own. In one sense, hitching his star to Nixon's was unfortunate for Kissinger, because the shame of Nixon will always be his shame, too. But in another sense it was lucky, because in the Cold War's last years Nixon unleashed him to pursue their shared ambitions on the world stage, not without some benefit. When Nixon fell, Kissinger remained standing, poised with a sly smile to gather the credit.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

From the Deep South to the simmering streets of Harlem, his characters embark on surreal and mythic quests armed only with wit, words, and wisdom. Championed by Toni Morrison, Walter Mosley, and Quincy Troupe, -Dumas&#x2019;s books have long been out of print. All of his short fiction is collected here, for the first time, and includes several previously unpublished stories.</p><p><b>Henry Dumas</b> was born in Sweet Home, Arkansas, moved to Harlem, joined the Air Force, attended Rutgers, worked for IBM, and taught at Hiram College in Ohio and Southern Illinois University. In 1968, at the age of thirty-three, he was shot and killed by a New York Transit Authority -policeman.</p></p><p>&#34;[Henry Dumas] had completed work, the quality and quantity of which are almost never achieved in several lifetimes. ...He was brilliant. He was magnetic and he was an incredible artist....[Dumas] was able to penetrate, almost like an archeologist, those areas that comprise the extraordinary, varied experiences of black people of all ages.

It&#39;s extraordinary.&#34;--Toni Morrison, in an interview with the &#34;Los Angeles Times</p><h2>Ibis: A True Whale Story (Wiggleworks)</h2><p>Children&#39;s whale story, environmental themes. Juvenile Beginning reading. True Story</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1-- If good intentions were enough to make a good story, this book would qualify. It is a fictionalized account of a true story about a humpback whale who becomes wrapped in a fisherman's net but who is saved by people in boats. Unfortunately, Himmelman attributes human emotions and thoughts to Ibis. At first, she decides that people are friendly: "Ibis liked them." But after the entanglement, which she correctly blames on humans, she is "confused and hurt." Even her facial expressions in the attractive pen-and-watercolor pictures show fear, unhappiness, and joy. Himmelman has honed down incidents to simplify the story, undermining the suspense of the real event, in which two dangerous rescue efforts were launched before Ibis was saved. According to Karen Smyth in her more interesting, more advanced book on humpback whales, Crystal , (Down East Bks, 1986), "The release of Ibis had been called impossible, and is now often called a miracle." In Himmelman's version, she is easily rescued. An overuse of exclamation points at the climax does not compensate for the lack of excitement and the stilted quality of the text. --Kathleen Odean, Moses Brown School, Providence, RI<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ibis is a young humpback whale, "curious about everything in the ocean." She and her friend Blizzard grow up together, looking at starfish and making friends with people and boats. One day Ibis gets caught in a fishing net; after extended struggling, she breaks loose, but part of the net is caught in her mouth and wrapped around her tail. She suffers for weeks, unable to surface or to eat without difficulty and pain. Finally, Blizzard finds Ibis and pushes her to the surface, where two rafts full of people help keep her afloat and untangle the nets to set her free. Based on the true story of the first successful whale-entanglement rescue, which took place near Provincetown, Mass., in 1984, Himmelman's ( Amanda and the Witch Switch ) soft, lively watercolors are very nicely composed. Although textual and illustrative personification throughout most of the book is strained, Himmelman's account of the rescue itself--in both words and pictures--is completely engrossing.

Vol. II: Oxford Text and English Translation</h2><p>Published to observe the twelfth centenary of the Battle of Roncevaux, the event that inspired the Chanson de Roland, this edition provides the first systematic analysis of the entire poem. Professor Brault&#39;s edition also incorporates the considerable scholarly work done in the half century since the Bedier and Jenkins editions appeared.The underlying theme of this new edition is that the poem is a Christian hero. As imagined by the poet Turoldus- writing about 1100, at the time of the First Crusade- Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne, had no faults and accomplished mighty deeds in warring against the Saracens. The introduction compares the known historical facts about the Battle of Roncevaux with the Roland legend, with various versions of the poem, and with the Oxford text. Christian thought and sensibility are shown to permeate the Chanson de Roland, in its character portrayal and narrative development, as well as in its tone and diction - and to provide its thematic unity and metaphorical consistency. Influences of the oral tradition of the chansons de geste are demonstrated, as are evidences of the accompanying gestures used by the jongleurs in interpreting these works.The Commentary organizes discussion of the 4002 verses into 49 units. The method of analysis is eclectic, combining thematic criticism with philology, exegetical interpretation with iconography. The 66 illustrations, primarily from Romanesque works of art, clarify key passages.</p><p><p>Gerard J.

In 1978, the year it appeared, this work was selected by <em>Choice: The Journal of the Association of College and Research Librarians</em> as an Outstanding Academic Book. In 1985, Professor Brault was elected International President of the Soci�t� Rencesvals (pour l'�tude des �pop�es romanes), the only American ever to serve in that office.

Her Thebes... is vividly captured: a place of hard light and sharp shadows, dust, fountains and dry heat. * Guardian * Atmospherically evoking a landscape of longed-for lakes and dark mountains, Haynes also subtly explores the "space between us and them" - between rulers and the people; parents and children; our personas and most secret selves * Observer * A wonderful and inventive take on an ancient tale -- Antonia Senior * The Times * Haynes has written her own version of the tragedy, finding new space in the narrative by looking at it through the eyes of two characters neglected by antiquity: Oedipus's mother/bride Jocasta and their youngest daughter Ismene . . . Some of this novel's greatest satisfactions come from the way Haynes translates the story out of the mythic and into a naturalistic register of love, loss and ambition . . . The ancient city state comes vividly alive in Haynes's hands, and canny deviations from the archetypal outline keep the suspense going. In The Children of Jocasta, Haynes has written a fine new story between the old lines. * Spectator * A passionate and gripping account of a famously dysfunctional family.

Or when a weapon that can hunt its own targets is hacked? Although it sounds like science fiction, the technology already exists to create weapons that can attack targets without human input. Paul Scharre, a leading expert in emerging weapons technologies, draws on deep research and firsthand experience to explore how these next-generation weapons are changing warfare.</p><p>Scharre&#x2019;s far-ranging investigation examines the emergence of autonomous weapons, the movement to ban them, and the legal and ethical issues surrounding their use. He spotlights artificial intelligence in military technology, spanning decades of innovation from German noise-seeking Wren torpedoes in World War II&#x2015;antecedents of today&#x2019;s homing missiles&#x2015;to autonomous cyber weapons, submarine-hunting robot ships, and robot tank armies. Through interviews with defense experts, ethicists, psychologists, and activists, Scharre surveys what challenges might face "centaur warfighters" on future battlefields, which will combine human and machine cognition. We&#x2019;ve made tremendous technological progress in the past few decades, but we have also glimpsed the terrifying mishaps that can result from complex automated systems&#x2015;such as when advanced F-22 fighter jets experienced a computer meltdown the first time they flew over the International Date Line.</p><p>At least thirty countries already have defensive autonomous weapons that operate under human supervision. Around the globe, militaries are racing to build robotic weapons with increasing autonomy. The ethical questions within this book grow more pressing each day. To what extent should such technologies be advanced? And if responsible democracies ban them, would that stop rogue regimes from taking advantage? At the forefront of a game-changing debate, <em>Army of None</em> engages military history, global policy, and cutting-edge science to argue that we must embrace technology where it can make war more precise and humane, but without surrendering human judgment. When the choice is life or death, there is no replacement for the human heart.</p></p><p>A former U.S. Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, <strong>Paul Scharre</strong> is the director of the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.

While it is hard to remember the exact details of the house, the memories of its inhabitants come quite easily. I can picture my hands on the furniture, always trying to spread my mess out onto our sparse belongings. I see my dad putting one of our purple tutus on his head and declaring to no one in particular, &#x201c;I am TUTU MONSTER,&#x201d; as he scoops my sister and me up in his arms while we shriek and try to scramble out of his grasp, giggling the whole time. He had a gift for creating worlds.<br><br>Our parents shape and create our reality. For a long time we have no sense outside of their worldview.<br><br>A while back I spent some serious time digitizing hundreds of decades-old photos tucked away in ancient red photo albums so that I could pull them up in a moment&#x2019;s notice. The images tell a familiar tale. Two little girls encased in baby buckets, looking up at the bad hair and fashions of the 1980s. Sometimes we are smiling in the photos. More often, though, we are not. We were born without so much as a wisp of hair, so naturally my grandma JoJo took to scotch-taping bows on our heads. She needed people to know that we were baby girls, not boys.<br><br>My mother is absent from these photos. It&#x2019;s just a flurry of aunts and uncles and Mountain Dew cans. My arms are chubby, and I am often reaching out for more. There is no baby book that recounts my first words or steps, but when I asked my dad in my teendom what my first utterance was, you better bet he said DaDa.<br><br>Meagan is so tiny in these early images, her body so small it looks like she could evaporate. Our nicknames mimic our stature; as luck would have it, I am known as Beefaroni and she, Noodles. I am often captured with a bottle in hand, and in a couple of photos, trying to grab the bottle from Meagan&#x2019;s hands.<br><br>There&#x2019;s one photo of my dad in these albums that I studied carefully. It&#x2019;s not like the others. He is in some sort of rec room, and he is standing up at a podium. He looks like he is clocking in around three hundred pounds, and he has a beard. Not exactly in fighting shape. Other men fill the room. He looks focused and nervous, photographed in midsentence.<br><br>I called Uncle Joe. He is warm and charismatic with a bald head and small circular glasses. I&#x2019;d been remiss in calling. Life had gotten busy.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember this photo?&#x201d; I asked, after describing it to him. &#x201c;What was he like then?&#x201d; <br><br>Joe paused to think about it. I could tell that he was placating me. This was the second time in ten years he&#x2019;d had to revisit a past that was very dark for his entire family. My dad spent some serious time excavating the facts of his life for his own memoir, The Night of the Gun. &#x201c;Well, your dad was a mystery to us. He tried his hand at treatment on numerous occasions, and it just never seemed to stick. We knew&#x2014;and I think he knew&#x2014;that this time had to be different. Must have been at a meeting.&#x201d;<br><br>We were the stakes. These little babies needed a parent, and my mother was not going to magically reappear from Texas or Mexico or wherever she was at that time. We needed him. &#x201c;But didn&#x2019;t that intensify the pressure?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, didn&#x2019;t your dad always thrive under pressure?&#x201d;<br><br>Why, yes, he did.<br><br>As Meagan and I age in the photos, our hair begins to grow and we go from looking like little old men to looking like little girls. Starting around age four, a soft white-and-pink checkered baby blanket starts appearing next to me, as if it were surgically attached. As I sought out other archival material from this time, I came across his column in the Family Times, a local paper that had given him some space to muse about life as a single dad. The column was aptly titled &#x201c;Because I Said So.&#x201d; In one installment, he told of how he&#x2019;d turned away for a second to look for my ever-quiet sister, and before he knew it I had gotten myself into our junker of a car and started backing out of the driveway. The minor heart attacks that surround the life of a young parent astound me.<br><br>In those early days in Minnesota we were poor. We needed government assistance just to get by&#x2014;something I have no shame about and am frankly grateful existed at the time. You can tell our circumstances from the backgrounds in the photos, but you definitely wouldn&#x2019;t know it to look at Meagan or me. Grandma JoJo was a hawk at rummage sales and would find matching outfits (plus bonnets, no less) for us to wear for family photo ops. My dad, on the other hand, looks pretty ragged. I can see in his face that the financial fear was alive and well. He, alone, was responsible for these two little beings. Sure, his family could help here and there, but they needed their money to stay in their own pockets.<br><br>In the photos, he&#x2019;s always looking at us&#x2014;his daughters. He isn&#x2019;t mugging for the camera, like he did in his early party-boy days. Instead, he is watchful, careful, and looks exhausted as hell. Someone caught him cracking a smile in one photo. We are at our grandparents&#x2019; and Meagan and I are standing on top of the picnic table. There are garbage bags that hold something bulky underneath. We are told to open the bag and OH MY GOD we each have our very own tricycle to ride! The next photo is me on my trike, in my Easter bonnet, grinning from ear to ear. Dad watches us with parental glee but also relief: Good, something to keep them busy.</p><h2>The Burning Man</h2><p>The author of Gone, But Not Forgotten delivers a fast-paced legal thriller featuring an arrogant attorney who attempts to improve his character by becoming the public defender of a retarded man on trial for murder. 200,000 first printing. $200,000 ad/promo.

Daniel argues that the unity of the Army of Tennessee--unlike that of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia--can be understood only by viewing the army from the bottom up rather than the top down.<br><br>The western army had neither strong leadership nor battlefield victories to sustain it, yet it maintained its cohesiveness. The "glue" that kept the men in the ranks included fear of punishment, a well-timed religious revival that stressed commitment and sacrifice, and a sense of comradeship developed through the common experience of serving under losing generals.<br><br>The soldiers here tell the story in their own rich words, for Daniel quotes from an impressive variety of sources, drawing upon his reading of the letters and diaries of more than 350 soldiers as well as scores of postwar memoirs. They write about rations, ordnance, medical care, punishments, the hardships of extensive campaigning, morale, and battle. While eastern and western soldiers were more alike than different, Daniel says, there were certain subtle variances. Western troops were less disciplined, a bit rougher, and less troubled by class divisions than their eastern counterparts. Daniel concludes that shared suffering and a belief in the ability to overcome adversity bonded the soldiers of the Army of Tennessee into a resilient fighting force.<br><br></p><p>"Daniel offers by far the best portrait to date of the soldiers of the Army of Tennessee. Working with an impressive array of unpublished sources, he has performed a long-needed service in bringing these western Confederates out from the shadow of their more famous counterparts in Lee's army."--Gary W.

The search of the woman's baby carriage was quickly becoming anything but routine, and Josh moved in closer for his next shot.<br><br>He'd just been keeping himself busy while awaiting the arrival of a delegation of peacekeepers from several superpowers who would be meeting with the pope that morning, but like several other members of the press and tourists who'd been ignoring the altercation or losing patience with it, he was becoming concerned. Although searches went on every hour, every day, around the world, the potential for danger hung over everyone's lives, lingering like the smell of fire.<br><br>In the distance the sonorous sound of a bell ringing called the religious to prayer, its echo out of sync with the woman's shrill voice as she continued to protest. Then, with a huge shove, she pushed the carriage against the guard's legs, and just as Josh brought the image into that clarity he called "perfect vision," the kind of image that the newspaper would want, the kind of conflict they loved captured on film, he heard the blast.<br><br>Then a flash of bluish white light.<br><br>The next moment, the world exploded.<br><br>In the protective shadows of the altar, Julius and his brother whispered, reviewing their plans for the last part of the rescue and recovery. Each of them kept a hand on his dagger, prepared in case one of the emperor's soldiers sprang out of the darkness. In Rome, in the Year of their Lord 391, temples were no longer sanctuaries for pagan priests. Converting to Christianity was not a choice, but an official mandate. Resisting was a crime punishable by death. Blood spilled in the name of the Church was not a sin, it was the price of victory.<br><br>The two brothers strategized&#x2014;Drago would stay in the temple for an hour longer and then rendezvous with Julius at the tomb by the city gates. As a diversion, that morning's elaborate funeral had been a success, but they were still worried. Everything depended on this last part of their strategy going smoothly.<br><br>Julius drew his cape closed, touched his brother's shoulder, bidding him goodbye and good luck, and skulked out of the basilica, keeping to the building's edge in case anyone was watching. He heard approaching horses and the clatter of wheels. Flattening himself against the stone wall, Julius held his breath and didn't move. The chariot passed without stopping.<br><br>He'd finally reached the edge of the porch when, behind him, like a sudden avalanche of rocks, he heard an angry shout split open the silence: "Show me where the treasury is!"<br><br>This was the disaster Julius and his brother had feared and discussed, but Drago had been clear&#x2014;even if the temple was attacked, Julius was to continue on. Not turn back. Not try to help him. The treasure Julius needed to save was more important than any one life or any five lives or any fifty lives.<br><br>But then a razor-sharp cry of pain rang out, and ignoring the plan, he ran back through the shadows, into the temple and up to the altar.<br><br>His brother was not where he'd left him.<br><br>"Drago?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Drago?"<br><br>Where was he?<br><br>Julius worked his way down one of the dark side aisles of the temple and up the next. When he found Drago, it wasn't by sound or by sight&#x2014;but by tripping over his brother's supine body.<br><br>He pulled him closer to the flickering torches. Drago's skin was already deathly pale, and his torn robe revealed a six-inch horizontal slash on his stomach crossing a vertical gash that cut him all the way down to his groin.<br><br>Julius gagged. He'd seen eviscerated carcasses of both man and beast before and had barely given them a passing glance. Sacrifices, felled soldiers or punished criminals were one thing. But this was Drago. This blood was his blood.<br><br>"You weren't...supposed to come back," Drago said, dragging every syllable out as if it was stuck in his throat. "I sent him...to look in the loculi...for the treasures. I thought...Stabbed me, anyway. But there's time...for us to get out...now...now!" Drago struggled to raise himself up to a sitting position, spilling his insides as he moved.<br><br>Julius pushed him down.<br><br>"Now...we need...to go now." Drago's voice was weakening.<br><br>Trying to staunch the blood flow, Julius put pressure on the laceration, willing the intestines and nerves and veins and skin to rejoin and fuse back together, but all he accomplished was staining his hands in the hot, sticky mess.<br><br>"Where are the virgins?" The voice erupted like Vesuvius without warning and echoed through the interior nave. Raucous laughter followed.<br><br>How many soldiers were there?<br><br>"Let's find the booty we came here for," another voice chimed in.<br><br>"Not yet, first I want one of the virgins. Where are the virgin whores?"<br><br>"The treasury first, you lecherous bastard."<br><br>More laughter.<br><br>So it wasn't one man; a regiment had stormed the temple. Shouting, demanding, blood-lust coating their words. Let them pillage this place, let them waste their energy, they'd come too late: there were no pagans to convert, no treasure left to find and no women left to rape, they'd all already been killed or sent into hiding.<br><br>"We have to go..." Drago whispered as once again he fought to rise.<br><br>He'd stayed behind to make sure everyone else got out safely. Why him, why Drago?<br><br>"You can't move, you've been hurt&#x2014;" Julius broke off, not knowing how to tell his brother that half of his internal organs were no longer inside his body.<br><br>"Then leave me. You need to get to her...Save her and the treasures.... No one...no one but you..."<br><br>It wasn't about the sacred objects anymore. It was about two people who both needed him desperately: the woman he loved and his brother, and the fates were demanding Julius sacrifice one of them for the other.<br><br><em>I can't let her die and I can't leave you to die.</em><br><br>No matter which one he chose, how would he live with the decision?<br><br>"Look what I found," one of the soldiers shouted.<br><br>Screams of vengeance reverberated through the majestic hall. A shriek rang out above all the other noise. A woman's cry.<br><br>Julius crawled out, hid behind a column and peered into the nave. He couldn't see the woman's upper body, but her pale legs were thrashing under the brute as the soldier pumped away so roughly that blood pooled under her. Who was the poor woman? Had she wandered in thinking she'd find a safe haven in the old temple, only to find she'd descended into hell? Could Julius help her? Take the men by surprise? No, there were too many of them. At least eight he could see. By now the rape had attracted more attention, drawing other men who forgot about their search to crowd around and cheer on their compatriot.<br><br>And what would happen to Drago if he left his side?<br><br>Then the question didn't matter because beneath his hands, Julius felt his brother's heart stop.<br><br><em>He felt his heart stop.</em><br><br>Julius beat Drago's chest, pumping and trying, trying but failing to stimulate the beating. Bending down, he breathed into his brother's mouth, forcing his own air down his throat, waiting for any sign of life.<br><br>Finally, his lips still on his brother's lips, his arm around his brother's neck, he wept, knowing he was wasting precious seconds but unable to stop. Now he didn't have to choose between them&#x2014;he could go to the woman who was waiting for him at the city gates.<br><br><em>He must go to her.</em><br><br>Trying not to attract attention, he abandoned Drago's body, backed up, found the wall and started crawling. There was a break in the columns up ahead; if he could get to it undetected, he might make it out.<br><br>And then he heard a soldier shout for him to halt.<br><br>If he couldn't save her, Julius would at least die trying, so, ignoring the order, he kept moving.<br><br>Outside, the air was thick with the black smoke that burned his lungs and stung his eyes. What were they incinerating now? No time to find out. Barely able to see what lay ahead of him, he kept running down the eerily quiet street. After the cacophony of the scene he'd just left, it was alarming to be able to hear his own footsteps. If someone was on the lookout the sound would give him away, but he needed to risk it.<br><br>Picturing her in the crypt, crouched in the weak light, counting the minutes, he worried that she would be anxious that he was late and torment herself that something had gone dangerously wrong. Her bravery had always been as steadfast as the stars; it was difficult even now to imagine her afraid. But this was a far different situation than anything she'd ever faced, and it was all his fault, all his shame. They'd risked too much for each other. He should have been stronger, should have resisted.<br><br>And now, because of him, everything they treasured, especially their lives, was at stake.<br><br>Tripping over the uneven, cracked surfaces, he stumbled. The muscles in his thighs and calves screamed, and every breath irritated his lungs so harshly he wanted to cry out. Tasting dirt and grit mixed with his salty sweat as it dripped down his face and wet his lips, he would have given anything for water&#x2014;cold, sweet water from the spring, not this alkaline piss. His feet pounded the stones and more pain shot up through his legs, but still he ran.<br><br>Suddenly, raucous shouting and thundering footfalls filled the air. The ground reverberated, and from the intensity he knew the marauders were coming closer. He looked right, left. If he could find a sheltered alcove, he could flatten himself against the wall and pray they'd run past and miss him. As if that would help. He knew all about praying. He'd relied on it, believed in it. But the prayers he'd offered up might as well have been spit in the gutter for the good they'd done.<br><br>"The sodomite is getting away!"<br><br>"Scum of the earth."<br><br>"Scared little pig."<br><br>"Did you defecate yourself yet, little pig?"<br><br>They laughed, trying to outdo each other with slurs and accusations. Their chortles echoed in the hollow night, lingered on the hot wind, and then, mixed in with their jeers, another voice broke through.<br><br>"Josh?"<br><br><em>No, don't listen. Keep going. Everything depends on getting to her in time.</em><br><br>A heavy fog was rolling in. He stumbled, then righted himself. He took the corner.<br><br>On both sides of him were identical colonnades with dozens of doors and recessed archways. He knew this place! He could hide here in plain sight and they would run by and&#x2014;<br><br>"Josh?"<br><br>The voice sounded as if it was coming to him from a great blue-green distance, but he refused to stop for it.<br><br><em>She was waiting for him...to save her...to save their secrets...and treasures....</em><br><br>"Josh?"<br><br>The voice was pulling him up, up through the murky, briny heaviness.<br><br>"Josh?"<br><br>Reluctantly, he opened his eyes and took in the room, the equipment and his own battered body. Beyond the heart rate, blood oxygen and blood pressure monitor flashing its LED numbers, the IV drip and the EKG machine, he saw a woman's worried face watching him. But it was the wrong face.<br><br>This wasn't the woman he'd been running to save.<br><br>"Josh? Oh, thank God, Josh. We thought..."<br><br>He couldn't be here now. He needed to go back.<br><br>The taste of sweat was still on his lips; his lungs still burned. He could hear them coming for him under the steady beat of the machines, but all he could think about was that somewhere she was alone, in the encroaching darkness, and yes, she was afraid, and yes, she was going to suffocate to death if he didn't reach her. He closed his eyes against the onslaught of anguish. If he didn't reach her, he would fail her. And something else, too. The treasures? No. Something more important, something just beyond his consciousness, what was it&#x2014;<br><br>"Josh?"<br><br>Grief ripped through him like a knife slitting open his chest, exposing his heart to the raw, harsh reality of having lost her. This wasn't possible. This wasn't real. He'd been remembering the chase and the escape and the rescue as if they had happened to him. But they hadn't. Of course they hadn't.<br><br>He wasn't Julius.<br><br>He was Josh Ryder. He was alive in the twenty-first century.<br><br>This scene belonged sixteen hundred years in the past.<br><br>Then why did he feel as if he'd lost everything that had ever mattered to him?<br><br>***<br><br><em>Rome, Italy&#x2014;the present Tuesday, 6:45 a.m.</em><br><br>Sixteen feet underground, the carbine lantern flickered, illuminating the ancient tomb's south wall. Josh Ryder was astounded by what he saw. The flowers in the fresco were as fresh as if they'd been painted days before. Saffron, crimson, vermilion, orange, indigo, canary, violet and salmon blossoms all gathered in a bouquet, stunning against the Pompeii-red background. Beneath him, the floor shimmered with an elaborate mosaic maze done in silver, azure, green, turquoise and cobalt: a pool of watery tiles. Behind him, Professor Rudolfo continued explaining the importance of this late fourth-century tomb in his heavily accented English. At least seventy-five, he was still spry and energetic, with lively, coal-black eyes that sparkled with excitement as he talked about the excavation.<br><br></p><h2>The Two Kinds of Decay: A Memoir</h2><p><i>Th</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i>e</i><i>v</i><i>e</i><i>nts that b</i><i>e</i><i>gan in 1995 might k</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>p happ</i><i>e</i><i>ning to m</i><i>e</i><i> as long as thin</i><i>gs</i><i> can happ</i><i>e</i><i>n to m</i><i>e</i><i>.

In this captivating story, Manguso recalls her nine-year struggle: arduous blood cleansings, collapsed veins, multiple chest catheters, the deaths of friends and strangers, addiction, depression, and, worst of all for a writer, the trite metaphors that accompany prolonged illness. A book of tremendous grace and self-awareness, <i>The Two Kinds of Decay </i>transcends the very notion of what an illness story can and should be.</p><p><b>Sarah Manguso</b> is the author of two books of poetry, <i>Sist</i><i>e</i><i> Viator</i> and <i>The Captain Lands in </i>Paradise<i>, </i>and the short story collection <i>Hard to Admit and Harder to Escape. </i>&nbsp; <b><i>The Beginning</i></b>The disease has been in remission seven years.

I still don&#x2019;t have a vegetable garden. I still haven&#x2019;t been to France.

And since 2003, this remarkable project has been collecting the stories of everyday Americans and preserving them for future generations. In New York City and in mobile recording booths traveling the country-from small towns to big cities, at Native American reservations and an Army post-StoryCorps is collecting the memories of Americans from all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life. The project represents a wondrous nationwide celebration of our shared humanity, capturing for posterity the stories that define us and bind us together.<br><br> In <i>Listening Is an Act of Love</i>, StoryCorps founder and legendary radio producer Dave Isay selects some of the most remarkable stories from the already vast collection and arranges them thematically into a moving portrait of American life. The voices here connect us to real people and their lives-to their experiences of profound joy, sadness, courage and despair, to good times and hard times, to good deeds and misdeeds.<br><br> To read this book is to be reminded of how rich and varied the American storybook truly is, how resistant to easy categorization or caricature. Above all, this book honors the gift each StoryCorps participant has made, from the raw material of his or her life, to the Americans who will come after. We are our history, individually and collectively, and <i>Listening Is an Act of Love</i> touchingly reminds us of this powerful truth.<br><br></p><p>Dave Isay is the founder of StoryCorps and its parent company, Sound Portraits Productions. Over the past two decades his radio documentary work has won nearly every award in broadcasting, including five Peabody awards. Dave has also received a Guggenheim Fellowship, a MacArthur Fellowship, and a United States Artists Fellowship. He is the author (or coauthor) of four books based on Sound Portraits radio stories, including <i>Our America: Life and Death on the South Side of Chicago</i> and <i>Flophouse</i>. He and his wife, Jennifer Gonnerman, live in Brooklyn.FROM STORYCORPS: THE CONVERSATION OF A LIFETIME<p> Recording your own interviews:</p><p> We encourage you to participate in StoryCorps. Please visit our website, www.storycorps.net, to learn about the locations of our StoryBooths across the country. We also have two permanent facilities open year-round in Manhattan. Come visit New York City, make an appointment and record your loved one&#x2019;s voice for history. If you want to record an interview but are not able to visit one of our StoryBooths, we encourage you to do-it-yourself. Conduct your own interview and ask the questions you&#x2019;ve always wanted to ask. You may well be surprised by the power of the experience. Here&#x2019;s how:</p><p> <strong><i>1. Pick a Storyteller</i></strong></p><p> Start the process by figuring out whom you want to interview. A grandparent? An old friend? Your mom? The person you invite might be hesitant. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have much to talk about,&#x201d; he&#x2019;ll say, or, &#x201c;You already know everything about my life.&#x201d; Remind your friend, your mother&#x2014;whoever it is&#x2014;how important you think their story is and how valuable it will be to future generations. Let that person know you would be honored to record his story.</p><p> <strong><i>2. Create a Question List</i></strong></p><p> No matter how well you know your storyteller, a little preparation will improve the quality of your interview enormously. What would you like to learn from that person? We&#x2019;ve designed a question generator to make preparing questions a little easier. You can find it at www.storycorps.net.</p><p> Here are some questions that have yielded great responses:</p><p> � What have you learned in life?<br> � What does your future hold?<br> � What are you most proud of?<br> � Do you have any regrets?<br> � What was the happiest moment of your life? The saddest?<br> � Is there something about yourself that you think no one knows?<br> � How would you like to be remembered?</p><p> We&#x2019;ve also found that at the end of a session it can be powerful to turn the tables and tell the person you&#x2019;re interviewing what they mean to you.</p><p> <strong><i>3. Purchase or Borrow Recording Equipment (and Get Comfortable with It) </i></strong></p><p> It is not difficult to make a terrific and clear recording of someone&#x2019;s voice. We strongly suggest that you create a recording with the best sound quality possible&#x2014;it&#x2019;s much more enjoyable and easy to listen to and will be appreciated by future generations. You will need three pieces of equipment: a recording device, a microphone and headphones. (You can learn more about equipment options at our website.) The recording equipment can be as simple as a micro cassette recorder or basic digital voice recorder, a pair of headphones and an inexpensive microphone (handheld, not clip-on). You can find both basic and more sophisticated recording equipment at your local electronics store. (StoryCorps also has a small equipment loan program called StoryKits, which you can also learn about at our website.)</p><p> Whatever equipment you choose, we strongly suggest that you practice using your equipment before you sit down for your interview.</p><p> A few things to remember:</p><p> � It&#x2019;s best to always wear headphones when recording. Your headphones are your &#x201c;ears&#x201d; for the interview; they tell you exactly what you&#x2019;ll hear on your finished recording. Use them to adjust the microphone position so the sound is as clear as possible.<br> � Hold the microphone close, about one spread-out hand&#x2019;s length from your storyteller&#x2019;s mouth. Always hold the microphone in your hand, moving it between you and your storyteller.<br> � Be careful of microphone noise. The low rumbling sound you hear when you move the microphone in your hands is known as &#x201c;mic-handling noise.&#x201d; You can avoid it by using a light touch and not shifting around too much. If you need to move the microphone, make sure to wait until your storyteller has finished speaking.</p><p> You may want to get together a group of friends and purchase recording equipment together. Someone from the group can act as the &#x201c;engineer&#x201d; during your interview and operate the equipment so you can focus on asking the questions. You can also share and talk about the stories you&#x2019;ve recorded with the group.</p><p> <i><strong>4. Choose an Interview Location</strong></i></p><p> <i><strong>Pick the quietest place possible. </strong></i> A carpeted living room or bedroom is often best. Avoid large empty rooms and kitchens, which are filled with reflective surfaces and appliance noise. We try to make the inside of each StoryCorps booth something of a sacred space, as peaceful and serene as possible. You may want to do the same: turn the lights low. Do whatever you can to make you and your subject as comfortable as possible.</p><p> <i><strong>Prevent noisy distractions. </strong></i> Close the door; unplug the phone; turn off your cell phone. Turn off anything that is making noise: buzzing fluorescent lights, air conditioners, fans. Listen for noise during the interview as well. If your storyteller fiddles with her necklace, for example, feel free to let her know it&#x2019;s making noise. Never record interviews with a radio or television on in the background.</p><p> <i><strong>5. Set Up and Test the Equipment</strong></i></p><p> Set up your equipment as early as possible and make sure you&#x2019;re comfortable with it. This way you&#x2019;ll be able to focus on the person you are interviewing and not the equipment. Before you begin your interview, record your storyteller answering a few warm-up questions such as &#x201c;Can you describe what this room looks like?&#x201d; or, &#x201c;Tell me what you had for breakfast.&#x201d; Stop, rewind and listen to the recording you just made to make sure everything is working. Remember to press RECORD again when you start the interview for real.</p><p> <strong><i>6. Begin the Conversation</i></strong></p><p> Start your interview by stating your name, your age, the date and the location of the interview. For example, &#x201c;My name is Annie Smith. I&#x2019;m forty-one years old. The date is November 23, 2008, and I&#x2019;m sitting with my grandfather Mark Smith in his living room in Hannibal, Missouri.&#x201d; Now ask your storyteller to state the same information. Use your question list. Remember, the questions you write in advance are just suggestions. Trust your instincts. If something interests you or merits further exploration, ask more questions. Sometimes your storyteller will need &#x201c;permission&#x201d; to talk about a certain topic. Granting that permission might be as easy as saying, &#x201c;Tell me more.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t let the question list constrain you. Feel free to ask questions in whatever order feels right. Take breaks if your storyteller needs them. Try not to say &#x201c;uh huh&#x201d; or interrupt when something interesting or important is being said. You can always use visual cues like nodding your head when you want to encourage the storyteller to keep going.</p><p> <i><strong>7. Get Great Stories</strong></i></p><p> Here are some tips for helping the conversation flow:</p><p> <i><strong>Listen closely. Look at your storyteller&#x2019;s eyes, not the mic. Nod your head. Smile. Stay interested and engaged.</strong></i></p><p><i><strong> <i><strong>Be yourself</strong></i>. You can laugh with the person you are interviewing or even cry with him. Real moments are the best moments.</strong></i></p><p><i><strong> <i><strong>Stick with the good stuff. When you hear something that moves you, feel free to talk about it more. If the current topic isn&#x2019;t what you wanted to put on tape, gently steer the conversation back on course.</strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> <i><strong>Ask emotional questions. Questions such as &#x201c;How does this make you feel?&#x201d; often elicit interesting responses. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to ask.</strong></i></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong><i><strong> <i><strong>Respect your subject</strong></i>. If there&#x2019;s a topic she just doesn&#x2019;t want to talk about, respect her wishes and move on.</strong></i></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> <i><strong>Take notes during the interview.</strong></i> Write down any questions or stories you might want to return to later in your interview.</strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> <i><strong>Be curious and honest and keep an open heart</strong></i>. Great things will happen.</strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> <strong><i>8. Wrap It Up</i></strong></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> Before you turn off your recorder, do two things: ask the storyteller if there is anything else that she wants to talk about and thank her. Sharing a story can be difficult for some people. It&#x2019;s a privilege to have someone share her story with you. Express your gratitude. If you have a digital camera, take a picture of your interviewee against a plain background (or, if there&#x2019;s someone else around, have him take a picture of the two of you) in the style of the StoryCorps pictures you find in this book.</strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> Make sure to label your recordings properly, make copies for relatives and friends and store them in a safe place so they&#x2019;ll be available for generations to come. (Unfortunately, StoryCorps does not have the capacity at the present time to enter these do-it-yourself interviews into our archives.)</strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> <strong><i>9. Share the Conversation</i></strong></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> The conversation doesn&#x2019;t have to end once you turn off your recorder. In fact, it may just be the beginning. With the permission of your storyteller, you might share the interview by making copies of your recording to give to family and friends. You might also host a listening party. Invite others to your home to listen to your recording and share a conversation afterward. You could also listen to StoryCorps stories on our website.</strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> <strong><i>10. Plant a Seed</i></strong></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> Storytelling can be a powerful tool, and your imagination is really the limit of what you can do with it. If you are a teacher, for instance, you might consider playing clips in your classroom as part of a history or writing unit. If you are part of a mentoring program, you could interview your mentor or mentee about their life experiences. Use the checklist and questions that follow to make sharing stories a part of your family, community or working life. <i>Congratulations! You have just joined the StoryCorps revolution!</i></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> DO-IT-YOURSELF CHECKLIST</strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> <strong><i>Things to Bring to the Interview</i></strong></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> � Your question list<br> � Recording device<br> � Microphone<br> � Headphones<br> � Extra batteries and tapes<br> � Pen or pencil</strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong> <strong><i>Before You Begin Your Interview</i></strong></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong><i> � Find the quietest place possible to record.<br> � Turn off radios and TVs and move away from noisy appliances like refrigerators and clocks.<br> � Make sure you and your storyteller are comfortable.<br> � Do a test recording, holding the microphone about one spread-out hand&#x2019;s distance from your storyteller&#x2019;s mouth. If anything sounds strange, stop and figure out what the problem is before starting the interview.</i></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><i><strong><i> <strong><i>During Your Interview</i></strong></i></strong></i></strong></i></p><p><strong><i><strong><i> � Double-check that the recorder is actually recording (not on PAUSE).<br> � Start each tape with an ID: State your name, your age, the date and the location of the interview. Ask your storyteller to state the same information.<br> � Don&#x2019;t say &#x201c;Uh huh&#x201d; when your subject is talking. Instead, nod your head.<br> � Ask emotional questions such as &#x201c;How did this make you feel?&#x201d; <br> � Look your storyteller in the eyes and stay engaged. <br> � Respect your subject always. <br> � Don&#x2019;t be afraid to stick with amazing moments in the interview&#x2014;if you hear something you&#x2019;re interested in, ask follow-up questions. <br> � Be curious and keep an open heart. Great things will happen.</i></strong></i></strong></p><p><strong><i><strong><i> <strong><i>When You Finish</i></strong></i></strong></i></strong></p><p><strong><i><strong><i> � If you recorded the interview on tape, label it.

Now in paperback!<br><br>Stuart's got problems. It's raining. He's bored. And worst of all, he's new in town, so he's got a lot to worry about. What does a kid like Stuart need in order to have an adventure? A cape, of course!</p><p><p><strong>Sara Pennypacker </strong>is an author of children's literature. She has received many awards for her books including the Christopher Award for <i>Clementines's Letter</i> and the Golden Kite Award for <i>Pierre In Love</i>. She has written fourteen children's books and travels widely to speak about literacy and to encourage reading and writing.</p>Pennypacker's (Dumbstruck) winsomely warped tale introduces eight-year-old, woe-is-me Stuart, whose family has just moved to a new town. The boy feels anxious about many things, including his new house ("What if there were man-eating spiders in his new bedroom closet? Or, a man eating spiders?"); getting locked inside the bathroom of his new school; and the possibility that no one in third grade will want to be his friend. "Stuart was very good at worrying. He was not so good at waiting." Impatient for adventure, Stuart suddenly realizes, "Adventures only happen to people with capes!" He fashions his own by stapling together 100 old ties and the adventures begin. The funniest scenario involves the cape-draped lad's realization that he can fly-but he can't land until his aunt makes a giant slingshot and sends him a pound cake to weigh him down. Most preposterous is the final episode: after Stuart's parents forbid him to wear his superhero gear on school orientation day, his cat falls asleep on his cape and ends up switching identities with the trash collector-but the upshot is realistic (Stuart makes a friend). Matje's (A Pig Named Perrier) pen-and-ink spreads and spot illustrations (a standout shows Stuart racing across the top of a spread, his cape-of-ties sailing behind him) amplify Pennypacker's quirky humor. The wry tone may be lost on some readers, yet others will happily escape with Stuart as he embarks on his confidence-building flights of fancy.

Human time superimposed on geologic time, all taken in at a glance, without any undue sensation of speed. </p><p>Gl�ck has been known as a lyrical and dramatic poet; since Ararat, she has shaped her austere intensities into book-length sequences. Here, for the first time, she speaks as "the type of describing, supervising intelligence found in novels rather than poetry," as Langdon Hammer has written of her long lines&#x2015;expansive, fluent, and full&#x2015;manifesting a calm omniscience. While Gl�ck's manner is novelistic, she focuses not on action but on pauses and intervals, moments of suspension (rather than suspense), in a dreamlike present tense in which poetic speculation and reflection are possible.</p></p><p><p>Louise Gl�ck is the author of eleven books of poems and a collection of essays. Her many awards include the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Bollingen Prize, and the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets. She teaches at Yale University and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><p>&#x201c;Though it resembles her others least, <i>A Village Life</i> may come to be seen as Gl�ck's most beautiful and moving book so far . . . [It] shows a ripening of Gl�ck's genius, her mastery for depicting the things of this earth . . . [and] can be seen as the work of a master poet who has done what many poets long to do: she has written about death immortally.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Fitzgerald, Rain Taxi</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>A Village Life</i> magnificently extends the landscapes, the harmonics, and the dramatis personae of <i>Averno </i>. . . More than any of Gl�ck's previous volumes, <i>A Village Life</i> has a generous heart, a large spiritual scope in which to imagine the lives of others.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rosanna Warren, The New Republic</i></p><p>&#x201c;Not many poets can be electrifying while keeping the stakes this hypothermically low. Gl�ck is a master, finely calibrating the shocks and their intervals. This collection, her 11th, is frightening the way a living statue would be frightening if it were to smile at you.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dana Goodyear, Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Here is a poet at the unmistakable peak of her expressive power and experience . . . The characters in<i> A Village Life</i> do what the voice tells them. &#x2018;It says forget, you forget. / It says begin again, you begin again.' Louise Gl�ck begins again, unforgettably, in this profound new collection of poems.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Carol Muske-Dukes, Huffington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;This 11th book of verse by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Louise Gl�ck offers beautiful language with a sense of loss and disappointment . . . The poems in <i>A Village Life</i> combine the intensity of her early work and the longer lines and insight of more recent books. The writing is often hauntingly beautiful . . . There are stanzas where Gl�ck makes her landscape seem so radiant or exquisite that you don't want to turn the page.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Elizabeth Lund, Christian Science Monitor</i></p><p>&#x201c;Like Cavafy's persona pieces, the real subject of these poems is often a particular mood, not the transmission of details that distinguish, say, a child's voice from a farmer's . . . Gl�ck lets us hear the silence that follows in the confessional. In my favorite poems in <i>A Village Life</i>, she also shows us what one who has heard that silence can now say.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Zach Savich, Kenyon Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Louise Gl�ck is one of America's most famous poets, and one of the best . . . The fictions here are really a pretext for Gl�ck to stage poems that explore, for the first time, material that is neither explicitly her own biography nor that of her mythical stand-ins. Always at the mercy of the Greek gods that inspired her earlier poems, Gl�ck now is playing God herself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Morgan Teicher, Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></p></p><h2>Easy Grammar Ultimate Series Student Workbook - Grade 11</h2><p>Using a prepositional approach, sentences are stripped to basics for students to identify subject and verb and to build on more challenging topics such as subject-verb agreement, predicate nominatives, and correct usage in all areas.</p><p></p><h2>Story of Painting</h2><p>Story of Painting</p><p></p><h2>Champagne, Uncorked: The House of Krug and the Timeless Allure of the World&#x2019;s Most Celebrated Drink</h2><p><b>The epitome of effervescence and centerpiece of celebration, Champagne has become a universal emblem of good fortune, and few can resist its sparkle</b><br><br>In <i>Champagne, Uncorked</i>, Alan Tardi journeys into the heartland of the world's most beloved wine.

The arctic fox is an extraordinary creature. No bigger than a house cat, it survives on almost nothing in the middle of a land so hostile it seems incompatible with the very existence of life. The tundra is a place of endless days or endless nights where temperatures can reach -58�F (-50�C) for weeks at a time, and where the terrain consists mostly of ice sheets, pack ice, ice floes, icebergs, ice shelves and glaciers. </p><p> <b>Arctic Fox</b> tells the story of this animal from its evolutionary beginnings to its difficult life in the far north involving:</p><ul> <li>Mating and raising a family</li> <li>Hunting and scavenging</li> <li>Its relationship with the polar bear and other arctic inhabitants</li> <li>The fur trade</li> <li>Adaptation to seasonal changes</li> <li>The never-ending struggle for survival in a fragile and vanishing environment.</li> </ul><p> This informative, lively and beautifully photographed book will fascinate naturalists and general readers. </p></p><p><p> <b>Garry Hamilton</b> is a journalist whose articles have appeared in magazines around the world.

Located on a plateau roughly 1,200 feet (400 m) above sea level, it is a terrain that's been pummeled for thousands of years by the activity of both glaciers and volcanoes. Its plains of lava dust are dotted with scattered pumice boulders and Daliesque sculptures of rock, giving it the look more of a moonscape than of a landscape. In August there's always a chance of a snowstorm, or a dust storm, and this would be tourist season. The rest of the year, owing to the latitude and altitude, it is as raw a place as one could imagine.</p> <p>In the summer of 1932 a team of English scientists from the University of Cambridge mounted an expedition into a part of Iceland's central desert so remote, so inaccessible and so barren that part of it remained virtually unexplored. They could have come from the north, across more than 100 miles (160 km) of barely passable fields of broken rock. Instead they came from the south, by ski and by pulling sleds, across a 3,127 square mile (8,000 square kilometers) mountain of permanent ice known as Vatnaj�kull.</p> <p>Part of their mission was to see how life returns after the physical forces of nature have wiped the slate of the Earth clean. Thus they were drawn to places amidst the lava fields where a hot spring or glacier-fed stream had allowed the faintest sparks of life to struggle forth. There they found and catalogued the hardy pioneers that were establishing themselves, however thinly. There were the beginnings of tundra-like vegetation, with patches of moss, sedges and even dwarf willow. There were various insects -- beetles, spiders and flies. There were several species of birds -- including ducks, swans and sandpipers -- that had been able to find, and survive on, the insects and water plants. And there was feces; feces from the only mammal on Earth capable of surviving this close to life's outer edge -- the arctic fox.</p> <p>In the accounts of their adventure, the Englishmen made no mention of being surprised at this discovery and there is no reason to think that they had any reason to be. During the previous centuries, Europeans had ventured forth into the far north for the first time since the age of the Vikings. When they returned, they routinely brought back stories of encounters with arctic foxes in the unlikeliest of places. This is an animal -- an animal no bigger than an old house cat -- that can survive on almost nothing, in the middle of nowhere, under conditions that seem incompatible with the existence of life.</p> <p>Until the 1980s, few scientists had ever studied the arctic fox in any great detail. And apart from a handful of magazine articles, very little has ever been written about the animal. Even in the eyes of popular culture, the arctic fox seems perennially overshadowed by larger, more charismatic celebrities like the polar bear, the walrus and the musk ox. Perhaps it's because so few people ever get to see an arctic fox. Perhaps it's too easy to mistake it for just another fox.</p> <p>But there is plenty to admire, beginning with sheer beauty. What is it about certain forms and patterns in nature that we humans find so appealing? Is it something we understand just because we observed our parents' pleasant smiles as they felt the soft curve of a rose petal or stared at a blinding streak of snow on a craggy peak set against a deep blue sky? Or is there something about certain things that transcends our culturally generated inclinations? Surely the arctic fox stands as an argument for the latter. Look at it curled up in its cloudlike pillow of snow-white fur, an icon for beauty if there ever was one. Perhaps there is something deep within us that recognizes this material for what it is, one of nature's greatest feats of engineering. It is believed that no other animal coat can match the insulating properties of arctic fox fur. On a living animal (as opposed to the shoulders of a socialite) it is like a meringue -- seemingly nine parts air; one part solid, or at least as close as a solid can come to mimicking the lightness of air. In observing the arctic fox curled inside this blanket of its own making, do we secretly imagine ourselves tucked away in this very definition of comfort? Whatever the reason, there is no denying that few of us can look at a picture of this animal and not be touched -- touched by the desire to reach out and run our fingers through this downy carpet; touched by the magnificence of nature. We look at the arctic fox and we are pleased.</p> <p>But beauty is only one aspect of this remarkable animal's appeal. Equally appealing, for very different reasons, is the arctic fox's ability to survive in what to most humans is an unfathomably strange place. This is the arctic tundra. It's a place where for part of the year there are no sunrises or sunsets or even high noons, just a mad dog sun that during midsummer circles around and around in a broad, halo-like orbit that gradually angles toward the southern sky before finally falling off the horizon entirely, not to be seen again for months. During this time, there is nothing but night. </p> <p>It's a place where not a single day of the year is without a chance of snow, where the temperatures can reach -58 degrees Fahrenheit (-50 degrees Celsius) for days and even weeks at a time, where storms whip winds filled with icy shards with the ferocity of a sandblaster, and where the weather report often more closely matches a location on Mars than most others on Earth.</p> <p>It's a place where the state of the nation is mostly described in terms of ice -- ice sheets, pack ice, ice floes, icebergs, ice shelves, landfast ice, frazil ice, grease ice, glaciers. It's a place where compasses don't work; where optical illusions caused by the sun and light and ice give the impression of mountains rising up from the horizon where no mountains exist.</p> <p>It's a place where trees refuse to grow and where, on the rare occasions when they do, they grow sideways -- strewn across the rocks like old ship cables. Even the bacteria here seem to have adopted a four-day week, apparently uncommitted to the job of decay. As for the geology, this is a land of gobbledygook -- of strangmoors, felsenmeer, flarks, aufeis and pingos: a world where the surface of the land oozes and flows and expands and contracts like some alien monster sponge. The arctic ground isn't soft and crumbly like the soil most humans take for granted, but a frozen tomb preserving ancient vegetation and the bodies of giant beasts that haven't walked the Earth for millennia.</p> <p>It's a land where no sound is what it seems. That cannon fire? It's two male musk oxen butting heads. That exploding building? It's a sheet of ice, as thick as a one-story building and as big as 10 football fields, folding into pieces by the force of ocean currents. Or maybe it's a 10-million-ton iceberg, top-heavy from decades of current wear, succumbing to gravity with a single, dramatic 180-degree backflip.</p> <p>The challenges facing life in the Arctic are extreme. First, there's the low temperature. Colder places exist, notably in Antarctica and farther into the Siberian interior. But the difference between severe and most severe hardly matters. When an Inuit ice fisherman hauls an arctic char out of a lake, the fish freezes solid within minutes. Living human flesh is no match for the arctic winter. "Certain parts of me -- cheeks and chin, particularly -- had begun to burn as if seared with a hot iron," wrote the French amateur anthropologist Gontran de Poncins after spending a winter in the Canadian Arctic, "and where the burning took place I felt the flesh suddenly harden. I was shriveling up. I tried to lower my head, to turn sideways away from the wind, to roll up in a tense and miserable ball. I was ready to give up, and for a word I should have broken into sobs. My soul was shaken. Nature here was too strong, there was no resisting her."</p> <p>The absence of sunlight is equally brutal. With limited solar energy there is little biological productivity, which in lay terms m</p></p><h2>Tiger Who Came to Tea</h2><p><p>The doorbell rings just as Sophie and her mummy are sitting down to tea.

The first Wool story was released as a standalone short in July of 2011. Due to reviewer demand, the rest of the story was released over the next six months. My thanks go out to those reviewers who clamored for more. Without you, none of this would exist. Your demand created this as much as I did. This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.</p><p>What would you do if the world outside was deadly, and the air you breathed could kill? And you lived in a place where every birth required a death, and the choices you made could save lives&#x2014;or destroy them?

When he was pulled away from the sea by the love of his life, he turned to his childhood dream of becoming an author. His Molly Fyde series has won praise from reviewers, and now his Wool series has become a #1 bestseller, with Random House publishing in the UK and Ridley Scott and Steve Zaillian securing the film rights.

Packed with maps, pictures, facts, and fun, it entertains as it educates.&nbsp;National Geographic's world-renowned cartographers have paired up with&nbsp;education experts to create maps of all 50 states, U.S. territories, Washington,&nbsp;D.C., and the nation. Large maps pinpoint the physical features, capitals, and other<br> towns and cities of each state. Kids will discover the latest data and trends, colorful photography of each state and the Americans who live there.&nbsp;Key points reflect the latest information about land and water, animals, and people&nbsp;and places. Lively essays cover each region of the country. Front matter includes&nbsp;information on what maps are and what this atlas will teach young readers.</p><p>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC KIDS inspires young adventurers to explore the world through award-winning magazines, books, website, apps, games, toys, television series and events and is the only kids brand with a world-class scientific organization at its core.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Some may say that atlases are pass�, given most students' heavy reliance on the Internet, and others may point out that materials on geography are plentiful. Nevertheless, kids will pore over this full-color book. National Geographic's bold, graphic approach ratchets up the cool factor. A detailed legend makes interpreting the maps clear. Divided by region (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and West), the volume displays two-page spreads on each state&#x2014;including a large, intricate, almost-full-page map of the state and notable cities and waterways. Pullouts indicate year of statehood, population, capital, flag, state bird and flower, and an additional fun fact (for instance, Pennsylvania's Hershey is the chocolate capital of the world). U.S. territories (including Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgan Islands) are identified on a map that shows their geographic relationship to the mainland. A final glossary and page of U.S. facts wrap up the work, which is illustrated with mainly stock but appropriate photography.

Here work has been translated into a dozen languages.She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous awards including the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest of the American Psychological Association..<br>The mindless following of routine and other automatic behaviors lead to much error, pain and a predetermined course of life, contends Langer, Harvard professor of psychology, in this thought-provoking study in which she "translates" for lay readers the findings of her research, much of it among the elderly. With anecdotes and metaphors, she explains how the mindless--as opposed to the mindful--develop mindsets of categories, associations, habits of thought born of repetition in childhood and throughout schooling. To be mindful, she notes, stressing process over outcome, allows free rein to intuition and creativity, and opens us to new information and perspectives. Langer discusses the negative impact of mindsets on business and social relations, showing special concern for the elderly, who often suffer from learned helplessness and lack of options. Encouraging the application of mindfulness to health, the author affirms that placebos and alternative, mind-based therapies can help patients and addicts move from unhealthy to healthy contexts.

As Woody Allen attests, he is the forerunner of today&#39;s comedians. This book evokes reflection and laughter. In Mort Sahl&#39;s humor and in his anger, America becomes his loving and righteous obsession. He makes us aware that politics is a sometimes serious, sometimes silly, and always dangerous game. Sahl was the first entertainer to argue the illegality of actions by the CIA and FBI, the first to question the official accounts of the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. He paid dearly for his belief, yet he never lost his audience or his respect for it. Sahl&#39;s humor is part of America&#39;s growing up. Laughter convinces that Mort Sahl is one of the most talented writers of comedy alive. And he&#39;s alive!

Why did high-minded, cultured Catherine choose not to accompany her husband to a grand party on the night of her demise? Why did she dismiss all her servants for the evening and leave the front door unlocked? What had been her relationship with the young man seen frequently by her side at concerts and art exhibits? And what can be done to avenge another terrible crime: the assault on Angeles Castelbranco, beloved teenage daughter of the Portuguese ambassador?<br> &nbsp;<br> As an ordinary policeman, Pitt used to enter London&#x2019;s grand houses through the kitchen door. Now, as a guest in those same houses, can he find the steel in his soul to challenge the great men of the world with their crimes? The path to the truth takes him in deeply troubling directions, from the lofty world of international politics and finance to his own happy home, where his own teenage daughter, Jemima, is coming of age in a culture rife with hidden dangers.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this rich, emotionally charged masterpiece, Anne Perry exposes yet another ugly secret of Victoria&#x2019;s proud empire. And in a courtroom battle of unparalleled brilliance, we thrill at the chance to witness a massive wrong righted.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Midnight at Marble Arch</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Sweeping and scandalous . . .

The light from the chandeliers sparkled on necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. Between the somber black and white suits of the men, the women&#x2019;s gowns blossomed in every color of the early summer: delicate pastels for the young, burning pinks and golds for those in the height of their beauty, and wines, mulberries, and lavenders for the more advanced.<br><br>Beside him was Charlotte, her hand resting lightly on his arm. She had no diamonds to wear, but he knew that she had long ago ceased to mind that. It was 1896 and she was now forty years old. The flush of youth had gone, but the richness of maturity became her even more. The happiness that glowed in her face was lovelier than flawless skin or sculpted features, which were mere gifts of chance.<br><br>Her hand tightened on his arm for a moment as they started down the stairs. Then they moved into the throng of people, smiling, acknowledging this one and that, trying to remember names. Pitt had recently been promoted to head of Britain&#x2019;s Special Branch, and it was a heavier weight of responsibility than he had ever carried before. There was no one senior to him in whom he could confide, or to whom he could defer a difficult decision.<br><br>He spoke now to ministers, ambassadors, people of influence far greater than their casual laughter in this room might suggest. Pitt had been born in the most modest of circumstances, and gatherings like this were still not easy for him. As a policeman, he had entered homes through the kitchen door, like any other servant, whereas now he was socially acceptable because of the power his position gave him and because he was privy to a range of secrets about almost everyone in the room.<br><br>Beside him Charlotte moved easily, and he watched her grace with pleasure. She had been born into Society and knew its foibles and its weaknesses, even if she was too disastrously candid to steer her way through them, unless it was absolutely necessary, as it was now.<br><br>She murmured some polite comment to the woman next to her, trying to look interested in the reply. Then she allowed herself to be introduced to Isaura Castelbranco, the wife of the Portuguese Ambassador to Britain.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you do, Mrs. Pitt?&#x201d; Isaura replied with warmth. She was a shorter woman than Charlotte, barely of average height, but the dignity of her bearing made her stand apart from the ordinary. Her features were gentle, almost vulnerable, and her eyes were so dark as to seem black against her pale skin.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you are finding our summer weather agreeable?&#x201d; Charlotte remarked, for the sake of something to say. No one cared about the subject: it was the tone of voice, the smile in the eyes, that mattered.<br><br>&#x201c;It is very pleasant not to be too hot,&#x201d; Isaura answered immediately. &#x201c;I am looking forward to the Regatta. It is at Henley, I believe?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed it is,&#x201d; Charlotte agreed. &#x201c;I admit, I haven&#x2019;t been for years, but I would love to do so again.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt knew that was not really true. Charlotte found the chatter and the pretentiousness of lavish Society events a little tedious, but he could see in her face that she liked this woman with her quiet manner.<br><br>They spoke for several minutes more before courtesy required that they offer their attention to the others who swirled around under the lights, or drifted to the various side rooms, or down the stairs to the hallway below.<br><br>They separated with a smile as Pitt was drawn into conversation with a junior minister from the Foreign Office. Charlotte managed to catch the attention of her great-aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould. Actually she was great-aunt by marriage to Charlotte&#x2019;s sister Emily, but over the years that distinction had ceased even to be remembered, let alone matter.<br><br>&#x201c;You seem to be enjoying yourself,&#x201d; Vespasia said softly, amusement lighting her remarkable silver-gray eyes. In her prime she had reputedly been the most beautiful woman in Europe, certainly the wittiest. Did they but know it, she was also one who had fought at the barricades in Rome, during the turbulent revolution that had swept Europe in &#x2019;48.<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t forgotten all my manners,&#x201d; Charlotte replied with her usual frankness. &#x201c;I fear I am reaching an age when I cannot afford to wear an expression of boredom. It is terribly unflattering.&#x201d;<br><br>Vespasia was quite openly amused, her smile warm. &#x201c;It never does to look as if you are waiting for something,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;Which is good. Women who are waiting are so tiresome. Who have you met?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The wife of the Portuguese ambassador,&#x201d; Charlotte replied. &#x201c;I liked her immediately. There is something unusual in her face. I&#x2019;m sorry I shall probably never see her again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isaura Castelbranco,&#x201d; Vespasia said thoughtfully. &#x201c;I know little of her, thank heaven. I know too much about so many other people. A little mystery lends such charm, like the softness of the late afternoon or the silence between the notes of music.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlotte was turning the thought over in her mind before replying when there was a sudden commotion a dozen yards away from them. Like those around her, she turned toward it. A very elegant young man with a sweep of fair hair took a step backward, raising his hands defensively, a look of disbelief on his face.<br><br>In front of him a girl in a gown of white lace stood alone, the skin of her bosom, neck and cheeks flushed red. She was very young, perhaps no more than sixteen, but of a Mediterranean darkness, and already the woman she would become was clear in the curves of her body.<br><br>Everyone around the two fell silent, either in embarrassment or possibly out of confusion, as if they had little idea what was happening.<br><br>&#x201c;Really, you are quite unreasonable,&#x201d; the young man said defensively, his voice light, trying to brush off the incident. &#x201c;You misunderstood me.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl was not soothed at all. She looked angry, even a little frightened.<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; she said in slightly accented English. &#x201c;I did not misunderstand. Some things are the same in all languages.&#x201d;<br><br>He still did not seem to be perturbed, only elaborately patient, as with someone who was being unintentionally obtuse. &#x201c;I assure you, I meant it merely as a compliment. You must be used to such things?&#x201d;<br><br>She drew in her breath to answer, but obviously could not find the words she wished.<br><br>He smiled, now openly amused at her, perhaps just a little mocking. He was good-looking in an unusual way. He had a strong and prominent nose and thin lips, but fine dark eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to get used to admiration.&#x201d; His look swept up and down her with just a fraction too much candor. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll receive a great deal of it, I can promise you.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl was shaking now. Even from where she stood, Charlotte could see that she had no idea how to deal with such inappropriate appreciation of her beauty. She was too young to have learned the necessary composure. It seemed her mother was not close enough to have overheard the exchange, and the young man, whom she now recognized as Neville Forsbrook, was very confident. His father was one of London&#x2019;s foremost bankers and the family had wealth and status, and all the privilege that came with it. He was not used to being denied anything, most especially by a girl who was not even British.<br><br>Charlotte took a step forward, and felt Vespasia&#x2019;s hand on her arm, restraining her.<br><br>The color had drained out of the girl&#x2019;s face, leaving her ashen. &#x201c;Leave me alone!&#x201d; Her voice was shrill and a little too loud. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch me!&#x201d;<br><br>Neville Forsbrook laughed quite openly now. &#x201c;My dear young lady, you are being ridiculous, and making something of a spectacle of yourself. I&#x2019;m sure that is not what you wish.&#x201d; He was smiling, and he took a step toward her, one hand out in front of him, as if to soothe.<br><br>The girl swung her hand wildly in an arc, catching his arm with hers and knocking it aside roughly. She swiveled around to escape, lost her balance and almost fell against another young woman, who promptly screamed and flung herself into the arms of a startled young man close to her.<br><br>The girl managed to untangle herself and fled, sobbing now. Neville Forsbrook remained where he was with a half smile on his face, which quickly changed to a look of bewilderment. He shrugged and spread his hands, elegant and strong, but the shadow of a smile remained. Was it out of embarrassment, or was there still the faintest hint of mockery there? Charlotte wasn&#x2019;t sure.<br><br>Someone stepped forward and began a polite conversation about nothing in particular. Others joined in gratefully. After a few moments the hum of voices resumed, the rustle of skirts, distant music, the slight sound of feet moving on the polished floor. It was as if nothing had happened.<br><br>&#x201c;That was very ugly,&#x201d; Charlotte said to Vespasia as soon as she was certain they were not overheard. &#x201c;What an insensitive young man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He must feel foolish,&#x201d; Vespasia replied with a touch of sympathy.<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth was that all about?&#x201d; a dark-haired woman near them asked confusedly.<br><br>The elderly man with her shook his head. &#x201c;Young ladies tend to be rather excitable, my dear. I wouldn&#x2019;t worry about it. It&#x2019;s just some misunderstanding, no doubt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who is she, anyway?&#x201d; the woman asked him, glancing at Charlotte also, in case she could shed light on it.<br><br>&#x201c;Angeles Castelbranco. Pretty young thing,&#x201d; the elderly man remarked, not really to anyone. &#x201c;Going to be a beautiful woman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s hardly relevant, James!&#x201d; his wife snapped. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t know how to behave! Imagine her doing that at a dinner party!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite bad enough here, thank you,&#x201d; another woman joined in. The brilliance of her diamonds and the sheen on her lush green silks could not disguise the bitterness of her expression.<br><br>Charlotte was stung to the girl&#x2019;s defense. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you are right,&#x201d; she said, meeting the woman&#x2019;s eyes boldly. &#x201c;You must know far more about it than we do. All we saw was what appeared to be a rather self-assured young man quite clearly embarrassing a foreign ambassador&#x2019;s daughter. I have no idea what preceded it, or how it might more kindly have been handled.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlotte felt Vespasia&#x2019;s hand fall very lightly on her arm again, but she ignored it. She kept the fixed, inquiring smile on her face and did not lower her gaze.<br><br>The woman in green colored angrily. &#x201c;You give me too much credit, Mrs. . . . I&#x2019;m afraid I do not know your name . . .&#x201d; She left the denial hanging in the air, not so much a question as a dismissal. &#x201c;But of course I am well acquainted with Sir Pelham Forsbrook, and therefore his son, Neville, who has been kind enough to show a very flattering interest in my youngest daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt now rejoined them with a glance at Vespasia, but Charlotte did not introduce either him or herself to the woman in green. &#x201c;Let us hope it is more graciously expressed than his unflattering interest in Miss Castelbranco,&#x201d; she continued in a tone so sweet as to be sickly. &#x201c;But of course you will make sure of that. You are not in a foreign country and uncertain how to deal with ambiguous remarks from young men directed toward your daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not know any young men who make ambiguous remarks!&#x201d; the woman snapped back, her eyebrows arched high.<br><br>&#x201c;How pleasant for you,&#x201d; Charlotte murmured.<br><br>The elderly man coughed, and raised his handkerchief to conceal his mouth, his eyes dancing.<br><br>Pitt turned his head away as if he had heard some sudden noise to attract his attention, and accidentally pulled Charlotte with him, although in truth she was perfectly ready to leave. That had been her parting shot. From here on it could only get worse. She gave a dazzling smile to Vespasia, and saw an answering sparkle in her eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth are you doing?&#x201d; Pitt demanded softly as soon as they were out of earshot.<br><br>&#x201c;Telling her she&#x2019;s a fool,&#x201d; Charlotte replied. She had thought her meaning was obvious.<br><br>&#x201c;I know that!&#x201d; he retorted. &#x201c;And so does she. You have just made an enemy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she apologized. &#x201c;That may be unfortunate, but being her friend would have been even more so. She&#x2019;s a social climber of the worst sort.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know? Who is she?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I know because I&#x2019;ve just seen how she acts. And I have no idea who she is, nor do I care.&#x201d; She knew she might regret saying that, but just at the moment she was too angry to curb her temper. &#x201c;I am going to speak to Senhora Castelbranco and make sure her daughter is all right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Charlotte . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She broke free, turned for a moment and gave him the same dazzling smile she had offered Vespasia, then moved into the crowd toward where she had last seen the Portuguese ambassador&#x2019;s wife.<br><br>It took her ten minutes more to find her. Senhora Castelbranco was standing near one of the doorways, her daughter with her. The girl was the same height as her mother, and even prettier than she had appeared at a distance. Her eyes were dazzling, and her skin softly honey-colored with a faint flush across her cheeks. She watched Charlotte approach them with an alarm that she could not hide, even though she was clearly trying to.<br><br>Charlotte smiled at her briefly, then turned to her mother. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry that wretched young man was rude. It must be impossibly difficult for you to do anything, in your diplomatic position. It really was inexcusable of him.&#x201d; She turned to the girl, then realized she was uncertain how fluent her English might be. &#x201c;I hope you are all right?&#x201d; she said a little awkwardly. &#x201c;I apologize. We should have made sure you were not placed in such an ugly situation.&#x201d;<br><br>Angeles smiled, but her eyes filled with tears. &#x201c;Oh, I am quite all right, madam, I assure you. I . . . I am not hurt. I . . .&#x201d; She gulped. &#x201c;I just did not know how to answer him.&#x201d;<br><br>Isaura put a protective arm around her daughter&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;She is well, of course. Just a little embarrassed. In our own language she would&#x2019;ve known what to say.&#x201d; She gave a little shrug. &#x201c;In English one is not always sure if one is being amusing, or perhaps insulting. It is better not to speak than risk saying something one cannot later withdraw.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Charlotte said, although she felt uneasy. It seemed like Angeles had actually been far more distressed than they were admitting. &#x201c;The more awkward the situation, the harder it is to find the words in another language,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;That is why he should have known better than to behave as he did. I am so sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>Isaura smiled at her, her dark eyes unreadable. &#x201c;You are very kind, but I assure you there is no harm done beyond a few moments&#x2019; unpleasantness. That is unavoidable in life. It happens to all of us at some time or another. The Season is full of events. I hope we will meet again.&#x201d;<br><br>It was gracious, but it was also a dismissal, as if they wished to be left alone for a while, perhaps even to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope so too,&#x201d; Charlotte agreed, and excused herself. Her feeling of unease was, if anything, greater.<br><br>As she returned to where she had left Pitt, she passed several groups of people talking. One of half a dozen included the woman in green, of whom she had undoubtedly made an enemy.<br><br>&#x201c;Very excitable temperament,&#x201d; she was saying. &#x201c;Unreliable, I&#x2019;m afraid. But we have no choice except to deal with them, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No choice at all, so my husband informs me,&#x201d; another assured her. &#x201c;It seems we have a treaty with Portugal that is over five hundred years old, and for some reason or another, we consider it important.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One of the great colonial powers, I&#x2019;m told,&#x201d; a third woman said with a lift of her fair eyebrows, as if the fact...</p><h2>100 Bullets Vol. 10: Decayed</h2><p>The noir masterpiece continues in 100 BULLETS VOL. 10: DECAYED, collecting issues #68-75 of the acclaimed Vertigo series.

Great History of Prussia.</p><p>Christopher Clark is Senior Lecturer in Modern European History at St. Catharine&#x2019;s College, University of Cambridge. He is the author of Politics of Conversion: Missionary Protestantism and the Jews in Prussia 1728&#x2013;1941 and Kaiser Wilhelm II, and the coeditor of Culture Wars: Catholic-Secular Conflict in Nineteenth-Century Europe.[An] enthralling, shrewd, and sparkling narrative... <b>Clark</b>&#x2019;s immensely learned, judicious, and entertaining book provides a definitive general narrative of its subject for our times... Clark&#x2019;s achievement is substantial. (R. J. W. Evans <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2007-09-27)<br><br><i>Iron Kingdom</i>, <b>Christopher Clark</b>&#x2019;s stately, authoritative history of Prussia from its humble beginnings to its ignominious end, presents a much more complicated and compelling picture of the German state, which is too often reduced to a caricature of spiked helmets and polished boots. Prussia and its army were inseparable, but Prussia was also renowned for its efficient, incorruptible civil service; its innovative system of social services; its religious tolerance; and its unrivaled education system, a model for the rest of Germany and the world. This too was Prussia&#x2015;a tormented kingdom that, like a tragic hero, was brought down by the very qualities that raised it up. Mr. Clark, a senior lecturer in modern European history at Cambridge University, does an exemplary job. A lively writer, he organizes masses of material in orderly fashion, clearly establishing his main themes and pausing at crucial junctures to recapitulate and reconsider. Prussia, a self-invented artifact right down to its name, demands the kind of careful demythologizing that it receives from Mr. Clark, who gently but insistently exposes the flaws in most of the received wisdom about his subject. A result is an illuminating, profoundly satisfying work of history, brightened by vivid character sketches of the principals in his drama. (William Grimes <i>New York Times</i> 2006-09-27)<br><br>To account for the rise and tumultuous extinction of Prussia is to explain how contemporary Europe came to assume its current form. It is a vast, Zeppelin-sized historical challenge; but it is also one to which <b>Christopher Clark</b> rises triumphantly, piloting his enormous subject through the best part of four centuries, traversing en route most of the continent of Europe, and carrying the reader with him on a bracing and exhilarating ride... For sheer range and intellectual horsepower, this book ranks as the best history of Prussia currently available in any language. However, more than that (and here it beats its German rivals hands-down), it is written with a literary finesse and narrative elan that establish its author as one of the finest writers of history at work in Britain today. It is a virtuoso performance. (John Adamson <i>Sunday Times</i> 2006-09-03)<br><br>This book can...be read for sheer pleasure... It is the pleasure of discovery that <b>Christopher Clark</b> offers in this account of the rise and fall of Prussia... Prussia was much more than its wars, but without its wars it would not have been Prussia, and they and their protagonists (Mr. Clark&#x2019;s Bismarck is priceless), origins, conduct, and consequences occupy a large part of this excellent book, which scholars of Germany and Prussia will want to ponder very carefully, and which many an unencumbered reader will simply enjoy. (Edward N. Luttwak <i>New York Sun</i> 2006-09-27)<br><br>From the military and agricultural innovations of Frederick the Great to nineteenth-century high academic politics to Bismarck&#x2019;s social-security system, this magisterial and remarkably well-written history of Prussia traces back to the eighteenth century the region&#x2019;s surprisingly tolerant and intellectually rich culture. <b>Clark</b>, a Cambridge historian, suggests that the world is poorer for Prussia&#x2019;s absence. (Benjamin Healy <i>The Atlantic</i> 2006-12-06)<br><br>[A] valuable book... [<b>Clark</b>] shows how complicated the history of Prussia really was, and how exciting were the contrasts in its history between religious tolerance and intolerance, enlightenment and obscurantism, centralized power and regional particularism, the rule of law and ruthless authoritarianism... Prussia and its army were full of contradictions, and Clark analyzes them astutely in his book, which is certainly the best recent history of Prussia... [A] masterpiece in which charming anecdotes and serious intellectual analyses mix comfortably with political and military history and descriptions of cultural and social phenomena... Clark&#x2019;s book seldom becomes dull, owing to the elegance of its style and the colorfulness of some of its powerful characters. (Istvan Deak <i>New Republic</i> 2008-03-12)<br><br>The story of Prussia is one that has been told many times, but seldom as intelligently, elegantly and interestingly as it is here. <b>Christopher Clark</b> has written a monumental history of a state that started from small beginnings as the Mark of Brandenburg, grew in size, violence and pretensions, and ended up being destroyed forever in 1947, when the victorious Allies decided they had had enough of this troublesome phenomenon... The bulk of a fascinating text, littered with intriguing detail and wry observation, focuses on this transformation in the 200 years from the bloody Thirty Years War in the 17th century (which cost Prussia half its population) to the creation by the Prussian nobleman Otto von Bismarck of a German Empire in 1871... Clark has written a masterly synthesis of [the] many disparate strands in a long and ultimately forlorn history. (Richard Overy <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2006-08-12)<br><br>It is only by contrary example that this book may remind us how miserable some hastily written products of the recent &#x2018;history boom&#x2019; have been. <b>Clark</b> is not one to swagger over the dead, secure in the knowledge that they cannot answer back. Instead, this is a well-informed and fair-minded historical investigation, written by a man who is plainly fascinated by the changing circumstances under which lives are lived and decisions made. One of the pleasures of this book is to watch Clark weighing the undeniable otherness of the past and resisting any tendency to convert it into a costume drama. (Patrick Wright <i>The Guardian</i> 2006-09-09)<br><br>Many states have been conquered, partitioned, occupied, &#x2018;ended&#x2019; and even destroyed. Prussia is unique in that it was formally abolished by decree of the British, American, French and Soviet victors in February 1947, after it ceased to exist in any meaningful sense... <b>Christopher Clark</b> begins <i>Iron Kingdom</i>, his history of &#x2018;the rise and downfall of Prussia,&#x2019; with this famous decree, but his remarkable book is not another exorcism, nor an uncritical celebration. He provides a sophisticated yet accessible account of how a middling German dynasty manoeuvred its way into the European pentarchy of powers. (Brendan Simms <i>The Independent</i> 2006-08-18)<br><br><i>Iron Kingdom</i> is a triumph of scholarship and imagination. This is a big book in every sense&#x2015;at almost 800 pages, it&#x2019;s not one to slip in your briefcase for the train&#x2015;but it zips along in a manner that belies its weight. In part this is because <b>Clark</b> writes so elegantly. This is history in its &#x2018;grand sweep,&#x2019; but his vivid sketches of characters, places and events lighten the narrative. Yet for all its entertainment value, <i>Iron Kingdom</i> is at heart an unflinching engagement with one of Europe&#x2019;s most complex and far-reaching political and cultural entities, spanning four centuries of history and, he suggests at the end, even beyond. (Richard Aldous <i>Irish Times</i> 2006-08-26)<br><br>You couldn&#x2019;t have the triumph and the tragedy of Prussia better told. <b>Christopher Clark</b> has a voracious appetite for detail and a tart turn of phrase. His study of Prussia, from beginning to end, vividly paints one of the big pictures of European history. (Peter Preston <i>The Observer</i> 2006-08-13)<br><br><b>Clark</b>&#x2019;s book, a survey of Prussian history from 1600 to 1947, is well-written, even sometimes sprightly, although it is hard to make easy reading of matters such as Pietism or the administrative reforms of the Baron Stein. <i>Iron Kingdom</i>&#x2019;s triumph lies in a narrative structure that is even more impressive than the mass of detail that forms it; and one feels secure in the hands not only of a scholar but of a humane and fair interpreter of history. (Max Egremont <i>The Spectator</i> 2006-09-02)<br><br>A massively impressive history of Prussia that surely takes its place as the definitive history of this much-maligned state. Elegant, entertaining, nicely illustrated and full of arresting characters, this is a terrific book. (Dominic Sandbrook <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2006-12-09)<br><br><i>Iron Kingdom</i> is not just good: it is everything a history book ought to be. The research is scholarly but never obtrusive, the prose sprightly but never flippant, the judgements bold but always sound... The nemesis of Prussia has cast such a long shadow that German historians have tiptoed around the subject. Thus it was left to an Englishman to write what is surely the best history of Prussia in any language. (Daniel Johnson <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> 2006-08-06)<br><br>This beautifully written and brilliantly argued longer study will reward scholars, students, and educated laypeople who invest the time to read it... [A] riveting narrative. (C. Ingrao <i>Choice</i> 2007-08-01)<br><br><b>Chris Clark</b>&#x2019;s new history of Prussia trumps all existing accounts. It commands four centuries of complicated history with extraordinary assurance. Its clear and confident argumentation, illuminating concreteness of detail, and sheer richness of texture make it the ideal general history. (Geoff Eley, author of <i>A Crooked Line: From Cultural History to the History of Society</i>)<br><br>Lucid, learned, and light-touched, this comprehensive history of the Prussian state and the society it molded eclipses its rivals, both Anglo-American and German. Its well-crafted narrative form is reader-friendly, while the interpretation it offers will impress seasoned specialists with its sophistication, knowledgeability, and freedom from stereotype and ideas of predetermined destiny. It will be required reading for all students of the history of modern Germany. (William Hagen, author of <i>Ordinary Prussians: Brandenburg Junkers and Villagers, 1500&#x2013;1840</i>)<br><br>Prussia was a project for state power invented by monarchs and landlords, generals and civil servants from the vulnerable provinces of north central Europe&#x2015;slowly mobilizing civic loyalties and reinvented for an age of German nationalism and encroaching democracy. In this epic volume, <b>Christopher Clark</b> enriches classic scholarship with the most recent findings to write Prussia&#x2019;s 500-year story from its unpromising Brandenburg origins through its manipulation by the Nazis and final dissolution by the postwar Allies as the byword for German aggression. (Charles S. Maier, author of <i>Among Empires: American Ascendancy and Its Predecessors</i>)<br><br><b>Clark</b>&#x2019;s great accomplishment is to tell the story of the Prussian state&#x2019;s rise and fall in a splendid and compelling way. His interpretation is a sustained critique of the still widely accepted view of Prussia&#x2019;s deviation from the western norm that led to the catastrophes of war and dictatorship in the twentieth century. <i>Iron Kingdom</i> is by far the best account of Prussia in English and as good as anything I know in German as well. (James J. Sheehan, President of the American Historical Association)<br><br>This book is everything its subject is supposed not to be: it&#x2019;s sparkling, light-footed and intellectually supple at every turn. Even more refreshingly, it narrates the story of a Prussia that was itself the source of much that was socially and intellectually progressive. The history of Prussia is a history of the West: we are all Prussians one way or another. This humane book, with its unflagging narrative sweep and deftness of touch, reveals the truth of that surprising statement.

In the tradition of David McCullough&#x2019;s <em>1776</em>,Lockhart illuminates the Battle of Bunker Hill as a crucial event in thecreation of an American identity, dexterously interweaving the story of thispivotal pitched battle with two other momentous narratives: the creation ofAmerica&#x2019;s first army, and the rise of the man who led it, George Washington.</p></p><p><p>Paul Lockhart combines military and political history to offer a major reassessment of one of the most famous battles in American history.</p><p>One hot June afternoon in 1775, on the gentle slopes of a hill near Boston, Massachusetts, a small band of ordinary Americans&#x2014;frightened but fiercely determined&#x2014;dared to stand up to a superior British force.

Lockhart tells the rest of the story, too: how a mob of armed civilians became America's first army; how George Washington set aside his comfortable patrician life to take command of the veterans of Bunker Hill; and how the forgotten heroes of 1775&#x2014;though overshadowed by themore famous Founding Fathers&#x2014;kept the notion of American liberty alive, and thus made independence possible.</p><p>Paul Lockhart is a professor of history at Wright State University, where he teaches European and military history.

In this lavishly illustrated work, with colour throughout, the author&#39;s aim has been to record as many different breeds as possible, thereby dispelling the myth that Staffordshire dogs were based solely on the spaniel. The book lists over 200 dog models and includes thirty-four breeds which have been grouped conveniently in alphabetical order. The discerning collector is provided with an insight into the quality of modelling and painting as the colour photographs have been restricted to the finest pieces to be found, even if that means including on occasions a good single example rather than an inferior pair. While some characteristics of certain dog breeds have changed over the past hundred years, thanks to the potter&#39;s skill most are still instantly recognisable.</p><p></p><h2>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</h2><p>A novelization of the upcoming feature film starring Luke Perry follows Buffy, a high school girl bearing the mark of the coven, as she uses the physical and mental powers new pal Merrick has given to her to fight L.A.&#39;s vampires.

It is a story of mid-life longings and discoveries, of lessons learned in the search for home and a new sense of purpose, and the bittersweet intensity of life with teenagers--holding on, letting go. <br> <br>Poised on the threshold between family life as she's always known it and her older son's departure for college, Kenison is surprised to find that the times she treasures most are the ordinary, unremarkable moments of everyday life, the very moments that she once took for granted, or rushed right through without noticing at all. <br><br>The relationships, hopes, and dreams that Kenison illuminates will touch women's hearts, and her words will inspire mothers everywhere as they try to make peace with the inevitable changes in store.</p><p>Katrina Kenison is the author of <i>Mitten Strings for God: Reflections for Mothers in a Hurry</i> (Warner Books, 2000).

She wrote, with Rolf Gates, <i>Meditations from the Mat: Daily Reflections on the Path of Yoga </i>(Random House, 2002).Many of us have had a stressful year, but few of us could write about it so lyrically. Even fewer could read this &#34;mother&#39;s memoir&#34; with such eloquence. In a voice so clear that you don&#39;t miss a word, Kenison describes her family&#39;s move and subsequent metamorphosis from a suburban Boston lifestyle to a rural New Hampshire existence, complete with hectic schedules, bunking in with grandparents, and the inevitable cost overruns of renovation. In the midst of this, she loses her longtime editing job. You may find her reading to be lacking in tonal variation, but you can&#39;t miss her love of family, empathy with her two very different teenage sons, sensitivity to nature, and optimism as they&#39;re revealed in this very personal journal.

And there was heartache aplenty to sing about: his teenage first wife, whom he began dating when she was 14, died in a motorcycle accident in 1966; two years later, two of his sons died in a fire that destroyed the family home. Already addicted to sleeping pills, amphetamines and fast motorcycles, according to this account, Orbison married a German teenager in 1969 as his personal life spun out of control and his career fell into near-total eclipse. His comeback, cresting in a collaborative album with Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and George Harrison, was cut short by his death in 1988. This well-researched bio provides vivid glimpses of the workaholic rocker's early years with Sun Records, his tours with the Beatles, his self-destructive tendencies. Amburn has collaborated on autobiographies with Shelley Winters and Priscilla Presley. Photos. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.It is not ironic that Roy Orbison, the man possessing one of pop music's most thrilling voices, sang tear-jerking ballads and hid behind dark glasses. As seen in Amburn's biography, Orbison's life reflects a full range of rock 'n' roll emotions: he rose to stardom in the 1960s, tragically lost his wife and two children, sunk into obscurity, reemerged to great acclaim, was voted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, then worked himself to death on the crest of a huge comeback. This evenly paced, unbiased, well-researched account of the singer's life is based on recollections of family, friends, and colleagues and material gleaned from print and electronic media. Orbison's transcendence of generations of rock, pop, rhythm and blues, and country music will give this book wide appeal.<br><i>- Donald W.

The years since have confirmed Lindsey&#39;s insights into what biblical prophecy says about the times we live in. Whether you&#39;re a church-going believer or someone who wouldn&#39;t darken the door of a Christian institution, the Bible has much to tell you about the imminent future of this planet. In the midst of an out-of-control generation, it reveals a grand design that&#39;s unfolding exactly according to plan. The rebirth of Israel. The threat of war in the Middle East. An increase in natural catastrophes. The revival of Satanism and witchcraft. These and other signs, foreseen by prophets from Moses to Jesus, portend the coming of an antichrist; of a war which will bring humanity to the brink of destruction; and of incredible deliverance for a desperate, dying planet.</p><p></p><h2>The Medic: Life and Death in the Last Days of WWII</h2><p>Leo Litwak was a university student when he joined the Army to fight in World War II, "a na've, callow eighteen-year-old son prepared to join other soldier boys being hauled off to war." In 1944 he found himself in Belgium, in the middle of the waning European war, a medic trained to save lives but often powerless to do much more than watch life slip away. It was hard fighting that took Litwak and his rifle company into the heart of Germany at the close of the war. But Litwak learned there was more to war than fighting, more to understand than maps and ammunition.<p> In the final months of the war, he watched the men in his company tenderly serve food at a Passover seder for a dozen brutalized Jewish women newly liberated from slavery. He watched those same men torture and execute defenseless German soldiers. He fell in love at the Moulin Rouge in a scene straight out of a Toulouse-Lautrec painting. </p><p> The men in his company were dreamers, thieves, friends, killers, revolutionaries, and heroes. They were the men of their time: sometimes brave, sometimes compassionate, sometimes cruel, sometimes loving, usually scared. They were held together by loyalty, only to be scattered by the war's end. <i>The Medic</i> is the gritty, wise, bighearted, and unflinching account of one man's quest to find sense in war and its aftermath.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>He was a college boy thrilled by the prospect of fighting what they were calling a good war. There were already eleven million people in the fight in the spring of 1943 when his troop train pulled out of the Detroit station. His parents watched uneasily from the platform knowing there was much to be afraid of, much more that he knew. He turned back and waved. I'll be fine, don't worry, he said. At last he had found a way to be useful, he thought. He would be a warrior.<p> Against his will they made him a medic. Instead of a rifle, they gave him bandages and gauze, sulfa powder and morphine. They trained him to save lives and ease pain, and they sent him into the hot center of the war in Europe with only a red cross to protect him. Through Belgium, the Sauer River, the Moselle Valley, and Saxony, he tended to men he admired and feared. In the clash and riot of war he came to know courage, terror, brutality, humor, and grace and at the end he was changed.</p><p> This is the true story of Leo Litwak, an award-winning novelist and former WWII combat medic. It's the story of real people in war: friends, saints, dreamers, thieves, jokers, killers, revolutionaries, and heroes. And it's the view in depth of a young American plucked from a cozy campus and sent to a foreign land to save the men who intended to save the world.</p><p> Few books have portrayed the grit and wonder of war with such eloquence, and still fewer have shown how war looks through the eyes of a soldier bent on saving lives, not taking them. The Medic is a compelling addition to the literature of war and a moving depiction of a young man growing up.</p><p></p>A book for the generations. In lean, quick, and ultimately eloquent prose Leo Litwak tells the truth about WWII. He speaks with a young man's toughness about events as they were. (Earl Shorris, author of <i>Latinos </i>and <i>New American Blues</i>)<p> A "brutal and yet frequently uplifting saga of war. There are no 'good guys' or 'bad guys' here, although the presence of both good and evil is constant. Instead, we witness ordinary men, most of them quite young, striving to survive a conflict that few of them understand. A disturbing, revealing, and very important glimpse of warfare." (Booklist)</p><p> "Litwak's timing is compelling, his characters are vivid, memorable, and real, and his story is laced with humor and insight." (Molly Giles, author of <i>Iron Shoes</i> and <i>Rough Translations</i>)</p><p> "<i>The Medic</i> is immensely moving, restoring to freshness a period fast disappearing into myth."

But whenever I see our prime minister and his distinguished sidekicks drive to the airport in black cars and get out and do <i>namastes</i> before you in front of a TV camera and tell you about how moral and saintly India is, I have to say that thing in English. </p><p> Now, you <i>are</i> visiting us this week, Your Excellency, aren't you? All India Radio is usually reliable in these matters. </p><p> That was a joke, sir. </p><p> Ha! </p><p> That's why I want to ask you directly if you really are coming to Bangalore. Because if you are, I have something important to tell you. See, the lady on the radio said, "Mr. Jiabao is on a mission: he wants to know the truth about Bangalore." </p><p> My blood froze. If anyone knows the truth about Bangalore, it's <i>me</i>. </p><p> Next, the lady announcer said, "Mr. Jiabao wants to meet some Indian entrepreneurs and hear the story of their success from their own lips." </p><p> She explained a little. Apparently, sir, you Chinese are far ahead of us in every respect, except that you don't have entrepreneurs. And our nation, though it has no drinking water, electricity, sewage system, public transportation, sense of hygiene, discipline, courtesy, or punctuality, <i>does</i> have entrepreneurs. Thousands and thousands of them. Especially in the field of technology. And these entrepreneurs -- <i>we</i> entrepreneurs -- have set up all these outsourcing companies that virtually run America now. </p><p> You hope to learn how to make a few Chinese entrepreneurs, that's why you're visiting. That made me feel good. But then it hit me that in keeping with international protocol, the prime minister and foreign minister of my country will meet you at the airport with garlands, small take-home sandalwood statues of Gandhi, and a booklet full of information about India's past, present, and future. </p><p> That's when I <i>had</i> to say that thing in English, sir. Out loud. </p><p> That was at 11:37 p.m. Five minutes ago. </p><p> I don't just swear and curse. I'm a man of action and change. I decided right there and then to start dictating a letter to you. To begin with, let me tell you of my great admiration for the ancient nation of China. </p><p> I read about your history in a book, <i>Exciting Tales of the Exotic East</i>, that I found on the pavement, back in the days when I was trying to get some enlightenment by going through the Sunday secondhand book market in Old Delhi. This book was mostly about pirates and gold in Hong Kong, but it did have some useful background information too: it said that you Chinese are great lovers of freedom and individual liberty. The British tried to make you their servants, but you never let them do it. I admire that, Mr. Premier. </p><p> I was a servant once, you see. </p><p> Only three nations have never let themselves be ruled by foreigners: China, Afghanistan, and Abyssinia. These are the only three nations I admire. </p><p> Out of respect for the love of liberty shown by the Chinese people, and also in the belief that the future of the world lies with the yellow man and the brown man now that our erstwhile master, the white-skinned man, has wasted himself through buggery, cell phone usage, and drug abuse, I offer to tell you, free of charge, the truth about Bangalore. </p><p> By telling you my life's story. </p><p> See, when you come to Bangalore, and stop at a traffic light, some boy will run up to your car and knock on your window, while holding up a bootlegged copy of an American business book, wrapped carefully in cellophane and with a title like: </p><p> <b>TEN SECRETS OF BUSINESS SUCCESS!</b> </p><p> or </p><p> <b>BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR IN SEVEN EASY DAYS!</b> </p><p> Don't waste your money on those American books. They're so <i>yesterday</i>. </p><p> I am tomorrow. </p><p> In terms of formal education, I may be somewhat lacking. I never finished school, to put it bluntly. Who cares! I haven't read many books, but I've read all the ones that count. I know by heart the works of the four greatest poets of all time -- Rumi, Iqbal, Mirza Ghalib, and a fourth fellow whose name I forget. I am a self-taught entrepreneur. </p><p> That's the best kind there is, trust me. </p><p> When you have heard the story of how I got to Bangalore and became one of its most successful (though probably least known) businessmen, you will know everything there is to know about how entrepreneurship is born, nurtured, and developed in this, the glorious twenty-first century of man. </p><p> The century, more specifically, of the <i>yellow</i> and the <i>brown</i> man. </p><p> You and me. </p><p> It is a little before midnight now, Mr. Jiabao. A good time for me to talk. </p><p> I stay up the whole night, Your Excellency. And there's no one else in this 150-square-foot office of mine. Just me and a chandelier above me, although the chandelier has a personality of its own. It's a huge thing, full of small diamond-shaped glass pieces, just like the ones they used to show in the films of the 1970s. Though it's cool enough at night in Bangalore, I've put a midget fan -- five cobwebby blades -- right above the chandelier. See, when it turns, the small blades chop up the chandelier's light and fling it across the room. Just like the strobe light at the best discos in Bangalore. </p><p> This is the only 150-square-foot space in Bangalore with its own chandelier! But it's still a hole in the wall, and I sit here the whole night. </p><p> The entrepreneur's curse. He has to watch his business all the time. </p><p> Now I'm going to turn the midget fan on, so that the chandelier's light spins around the room. </p><p> I am relaxed, sir. As I hope you are. </p><p> Let us begin. </p><p> Before we do that, sir, the phrase in English that I learned from my ex-employer the late Mr. Ashok's ex-wife Pinky Madam is: </p><p> <i>What a fucking joke</i>. </p><p> <b> -- -- -- </b> </p><p> Now, I no longer watch Hindi films -- on principle -- but back in the days when I used to, just before the movie got started, either the number 786 would flash against the black screen -- the Muslims think this is a magic number that represents their god -- or else you would see the picture of a woman in a white sari with gold sovereigns dripping down to her feet, which is the goddess Lakshmi, of the Hindus. </p><p> It is an ancient and venerated custom of people in my country to start a story by praying to a Higher Power. </p><p> I guess, Your Excellency, that I too should start off by kissing some god's arse. </p><p> <i>Which</i> god's arse, though? There are so many choices. </p><p> See, the Muslims have one god. </p><p> The Christians have three gods. </p><p> And we Hindus have 36,000,000 gods. </p><p> Making a grand total of 36,000,004 divine arses for me to choose from. </p><p> Now, there are some, and I don't just mean Communists like you, but thinking men of all political parties, who think that not many of these gods actually exist. Some believe that <i>none</i> of them exist. There's just us and an ocean of darkness around us. I'm no philosopher or poet, how would I know the truth? It's true that all these gods seem to do awfully little work -- much like our politicians -- and yet keep winning reelection to their golden thrones in heaven, year after year. That's not to say that I don't respect them, Mr. Premier! Don't you ever let that blasphemous idea into your yellow skull. My country is the kind where it pays to play it both ways: the Indian entrepreneur has to be straight and crooked, mocking and believing, sly and sincere, at the same time. </p><p> So: I'm closing my eyes, folding my hands in a reverent <i>namaste</i>, and praying to the gods to shine light on my dark story. </p><p> Bear with me, Mr. Jiabao. This could take a while. </p><p> How quickly do you think you could kiss 36,000,004 arses? </p><p> <b> -- -- -- </b> </p><p> Done. </p><p> My eyes are open again. </p><p> 11:52 p.m. -- and it really is time to start. </p><p> A statutory warning -- as they say on cigarette packs -- before we begin. </p><p> One day, as I was driving my ex-employers Mr. Ashok and Pinky Madam in their Honda City car, Mr. Ashok put a hand on my shoulder, and said, "Pull over to the side." Following this command, he leaned forward so close that I could smell his aftershave -- it was a delicious, fruitlike smell that day -- and said, politely as ever, "Balram, I have a few questions to ask you, all right?" </p><p> "Yes, sir," I said. </p><p> "Balram," Mr. Ashok asked, "how many planets are there in the sky?" </p><p> I gave the answer as best as I could. </p><p> "Balram, who was the first prime minister of India?" </p><p> And then: "Balram, what is the difference between a Hindu and a Muslim?" </p><p> And then: "What is the name of our continent?" </p><p> Mr. Ashok leaned back and asked Pinky Madam, "Did you hear his answers?" </p><p> "Was he joking?" she asked, and my heart beat faster, as it did every time she said something. </p><p> "No. That's <i>really</i> what he thinks the correct answers are." </p><p> She giggled when she heard this: but <i>his</i> face, which I saw reflected in my rearview mirror, was serious. </p><p> "The thing is, he probably has...what, two, three years of schooling in him? He can read and write, but he doesn't get what he's read. He's half-baked. The country is full of people like him, I'll tell yo...</p></p><h2>Clambake: A Wampanoag Tradition (We Are Still Here : Native Americans Today)</h2><p>Follows Steven Peters, a Mashpee Wampanoag, as he celebrates a traditional clambake</p><p>Grade 3-5-- For the Wampanoag Indians (the descendants of those who greeted the Pilgrims at Plymouth in 1620) in Mashpee, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, the clambake is more than just a many-splendored outdoor dinner; it is a traditional ceremony of their people. Twelve-year-old Steven Peters, grandson of the author, learns from Peters the history and traditions of their people, including the creation of a special clambake. The physical preparation for this occasion, honoring an elder in the tribe, is described clearly enough for readers to try it, but also conveyed is the underlying respect for nature and one another. There are helpful maps, a glossary and pronunciation guide, and a good list of books for further reading. The full-color photographs illustrate the clearly written text and portray real people who are part of the contemporary world, passing on old traditions to their children. --Carolyn Jenks, formerly at Oyster River Elementary School, Durham, NH<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Oregon Legacy (The Holts : An American Dynasty, No 1)</h2><p>As Toby Holt battles to save his ranch from the harsh winter weather of 1887, his headstrong son, Tim, sets out to seek his fortune in the silver mines</p><p>The Holts and their extended family of employees and friends give readers a glimpse at the good, the bad and the ugly forces driving the early West: self-determination, camaraderie, greed and racial bigotry. Set in the 1880s, the novel journeys from Oregon to Nevada depicting the travails of silver mining, a scarlet fever epidemic et al. The characters are well drawn and diverse: patriarch Toby Holt and his son Tim are plucky, self-made men of integrity; Janessa, Toby's half-Indian daughter out of wedlock, wants to become a doctor but must deal with prejudice and sexual harassment; the Holts' foreman, White Elk, bears the weight of society's judgment when he falls in love with a Chinese immigrant. Ross presents endearing players in a nicely paced family drama, the first in a projected multivolume saga that continues where the bestselling Wagons West series left off. The action is low-key yet interesting, the story line is handled with sensitivity and skill. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Selected Letters of Philip Larkin, 1940-1985</h2><p>Seven hundred of the great poet&#39;s letters are collected here offering a moving, instructive portrait of Larken, from his early correspondence with school friends to his last year of life, 1985, when he died at the age of sixty-three.</p><p>Philip Larkin was born in Coventry in 1922 and was educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry, and St John&#39;s College, Oxford. As well as his volumes of poems, which include The Whitsun Weddings and High Windows, he wrote two novels, Jill and A Girl in Winter, and two books of collected journalism: All What Jazz: A Record Diary, and Required Writing: Miscellaneous Prose. He worked as a librarian at the University of Hull from 1955 until his death in 1985. He was the best-loved poet of his generation, and the recipient of innumerable honours, including the Queen&#39;s Gold Medal for Poetry, and the WHSmith Award. As one of Philip Larkin&#39;s chosen literary executors, Anthony Thwaite edited the Collected Poems, Selected Letters and Further Requirements. His own Collected Poems, drawing on fifty years work, was published in 2007.Readers of Andrew Motion's recent biography (p. 646) of Larkin (d. 1985), who's now recognized as one of the great poets of our century, won't be surprised by the revelations in this generous selection of letters. Larkin's misguided sympathy for Germany in the early years of WW II, his cranky xenophobia, his outrageous misogyny, and his devastating put-downs of other poets (especially Stephen Spender, Ted Hughes, and Vikram Seth) should also come as no surprise. After all, his problems with women, his severe melancholia, and his deep- rooted misanthropy are everywhere evident in the poetry. Not to be overlooked in all the disagreeable material, though, are the elements often missing in Motion's somewhat humorless tome. In his own words, Larkin is a constant pleasure--witty, slangy, and full of profound insight into the writers who matter most to him, from his early admiration of Auden, Lawrence, and Yeats to his later veneration of fellow plain-speaking poets such as Hardy, Edward Thomas, and Gavin Ewart. Heavily represented among the recipients of these 700-odd letters are Larkin's grade-school buddies, publishers, and a few solid literary friends. With his pals, Larkin indulged his love of vulgarity: A proud masturbator, he trades soft-core porn tips with his kindred spirit, Kingsley Amis, and with poet-historian Robert Conquest. Larkin's lifelong devotion to jazz surfaces not only in his numerous discussions of favorite albums but also in the rhythms of his prose. Most touching of all, though, is the poet's long epistolary friendship with Barbara Pym, a lovely testament to their spiritual affinity--they didn't meet until very late in their correspondence. Editor Thwaite (one of Larkin's three executors) never adequately explains the most glaring omission here--the poet's letters to family members. But to Thwaite's credit, he annotates with a light hand, ensuring that no one interested in Larkin or the course of modern poetry can afford to ignore this spectacular volume.

Few games were televised nationally and the NCAA tournament had just expanded from thirty-two to forty teams. Into this world came two exceptional players: Earvin "Magic" Johnson and Larry Bird. Though they played each other only once, in the 1979 NCAA finals, that meeting launched an epic rivalry, transformed the NCAA tournament into the multibillion-dollar event it is today, and laid the groundwork for the resurgence of the NBA. </p><p>In <i>When March Went Mad</i>, Seth Davis recounts the dramatic story of the season leading up to that game, as Johnson&#x2019;s Michigan State Spartans and Bird&#x2019;s Indiana State Sycamores overcame long odds and great doubts that their unheralded teams could compete at the highest level. Davis also tells the stories of their remarkable coaches, Jud Heathcote and Bill Hodges&#x2014;who were new to their schools but who set their own paths to build great teams&#x2014;and he shows how tensions over race and class heightened the drama of the competition. When Magic and Bird squared off in Salt Lake City on March 26, 1979, the world took notice&#x2014;to this day it remains the most watched basketball game in the history of television&#x2014;and the sport we now know was born. </p></p><p><p>Seth Davis is an on-air studio analyst for CBS Sports coverage of NCAA basketball and is an on-air host, reporter, and analyst for the College Sports Television cable network. He is also a staff writer at <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, where he has worked since 1995, primarily covering college basketball and golf. A graduate of Duke University, Davis lives with his family in Ridgefield, Connecticut.</p><p>PROLOGUE </p><p>On Sunday evening, March 25, 1979, the NBC Sports production team gathered in a conference room at the Hotel Utah in Salt Lake City to go over the game plan for the following night&#x2019;s NCAA men&#x2019;s basketball championship game. George Finkel, the game producer, spoke first. He laid out the manner in which he and his broadcasting team of Dick Enberg, Al McGuire, and Billy Packer would be presenting the contest between Michigan State and Indiana State. </p><p>The next person to speak was Don McGuire (no relation to Al), who produced the pregame, halftime, and postgame segments that were hosted by Bryant Gumbel. Before beginning a career in television, McGuire had worked as the sports information director at the University of New Mexico, where the associate athletic director was a man named Bob King. King had since moved on to become head basketball coach at Indiana State University, but before the start of the 1978&#x2013;79 season, he developed an aneurysm in his brain and had to undergo emergency surgery. That forced King to hand over the reins to his young assistant, Bill Hodges, who despite having no previous head coaching experience had guided the Sycamores to a stunning 33&#x2013;0 record and a berth in the national championship game. Now, McGuire told the group that he wanted to air a story on King, the incapacitated head coach, during NBC&#x2019;s pregame segment on Monday night. </p><p>McGuire was abruptly interrupted by Don Ohlmeyer, the executive producer of NBC Sports. A large, domineering, and sometimes bombastic man, Ohlmeyer had spent a decade at ABC Sports learning at the knee of the legendary producer Roone Arledge. While working for the popular, eclectic program <i>Wide World of Sports</i>, Ohlmeyer learned the importance of developing a story line to pump up interest in a sporting event. </p><p>"Nobody cares about Bob King," Ohlmeyer said to Don McGuire. "What about Magic and Bird?" </p><p>Ohlmeyer was referring to Earvin "Magic" Johnson and Larry Bird, the All-American stars at Michigan State University and Indiana State, respectively. An uncomfortable silence fell on the room. "Well," McGuire said, "Dick, Al, and Billy are going to be talking a lot about those two during the game. And we&#x2019;ve got a highlights piece set to music ready to go for halftime." </p><p>"Well, you&#x2019;re going to do them in the pregame, too," Ohlmeyer snapped. "Those guys are the stars here. That&#x2019;s who people want to see." </p><p>Ohlmeyer&#x2019;s edict left McGuire in a bit of a pickle. In the first place, he now had less than twenty-four hours to put together a quality piece. More problematic was Bird&#x2019;s notorious antipathy toward the media. He had gone through most of the season without speaking to the press, and McGuire had no idea whether Bird would consent to be interviewed so close to tip-off. </p><p>The following morning, Don McGuire sent Packer and a camera crew to the University of Utah&#x2019;s Special Events Center, where the Indiana State Sycamores were just completing their game-day shootaround. Fortunately for NBC, Bird agreed to answer a couple of questions. Packer began by asking him how he felt about playing for the national championship. </p><p>"Well, this is probably the biggest game I&#x2019;ll ever play in my life," Bird replied in his high-pitched Hoosier twang, which made "life" sound like "lahff." As he spoke, Larry looked not at Packer but straight ahead and slightly downward. He had a disconcerting habit of resisting eye contact with people he didn&#x2019;t know well. </p><p>Bird continued, "I just feel like I&#x2019;m representing not only myself and my team, but we&#x2019;re representing our school and our town, Terre Haute. It means so much to me just to even be here that we&#x2019;re gonna give it all we got, and we&#x2019;re gonna try our hardest to win." </p><p>"You know," Packer said, "a lot of people were surprised yesterday, Larry, when you mentioned you played ball with Magic Johnson in the World Invitational Tournament." Packer was referring to the tournament the two of them played for Team USA the previous summer that culminated with a game against a squad from Russia in Lexington, Kentucky. </p><p>Larry cracked a wry smile. "Well, you know me and Magic played in that game, and you know it&#x2019;s funny &#x2019;cause Magic&#x2019;s such a great passer, but he wouldn&#x2019;t give me the ball. And you know I need the ball." </p><p>The interview had been surprisingly pleasant and light. Larry left the court with his team, and the Michigan State Spartans strode into the arena. Packer knew there was no concern over whether Magic Johnson would consent to an interview. The broadcaster had never dealt with an athlete who so enjoyed the give-and-take with the media. </p><p>"It&#x2019;s a dream come true, really, for me," Johnson said in answer to Packer&#x2019;s first question. "I won a state title [in high school] back in my home state, and then my next accomplishment was going to the NCAA and playing a game like tonight in the finals. It&#x2019;s a dream come true, and like I said, it&#x2019;s an awful important game. I just hope we play up to par and win the game." </p><p>Packer then told Magic what Bird had said about him. Johnson flashed the bright ivory smile that would soon earn him millions of dollars. "Well, I hope he don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m gonna pass it to him tonight, either. But I thought I passed him the ball. Maybe he forgot." </p><p>Don McGuire was pleased to hear that Packer&#x2019;s excursion had been successful. He now had enough material to make NBC&#x2019;s pregame show an all-Magic-and-Bird affair. In retrospect, it seems inconceivable that anyone involved in producing the game could have failed to recognize the significance of the impending confrontation between these two compelling characters. Ohlmeyer, however, possessed an innate sense of theater that allowed him to see beyond the attraction the game would have for a hard-core basketball audience. He knew that if NBC could draw in the casual sports fan, and even the nonsports fan, the network would have something bigger than just a game. It would have an event. </p><p>By one measure, the impact of the 1979 NCAA championship game would be apparent a few days later. Nielsen Media Research reported that the contest had generated a 24.1 rating, which meant that nearly a quarter of all television sets in America were tuned in that night. Thirty years later, that remains the highest Nielsen rating for any basketball game, college or pro, in the history of the sport. Thanks to the proliferation of channels that has taken place since then, it&#x2019;s unlikely the number will ever be surpassed by another basketball game. Consider that the 2008 NCAA final between the University of Memphis and the University of Kansas yielded a 12.1 Nielsen rating, a healthy number by modern standards. When Magic&#x2019;s and Bird&#x2019;s former pro teams, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics, met in the 2008 NBA Finals, it was hailed as a dream scenario for the league. Yet the highest rating any of the six games delivered was a 10.7. </p><p>While the success that Magic and Bird later enjoyed in the pros added retrospective luster to their first meeting, it does not account for the intense interest the two of them generated that night. Those millions of viewers had no idea they were watching the birth of the most storied rivalry in modern American sports. They were simply drawn in by the dramatic story line ripped straight out of the Old Testament: little Indiana State, which had competed in the NCAA&#x2019;s Division I for only ten years, was taking on Michigan State, the mighty Big Ten team, for the title. That concept might not have been so titillating if they were playing a best-of-seven series, but the one-and-done format of the NCAA tournament made it irresistible. Anything could happen, the thinking went, so you&#x2019;d better watch. "This was a classic David versus Goliath story," Ohlmeyer says. "It made people feel like this was a once-in-a-lifetime event." </p><p>"It was testimony to America&#x2019;s fervor for the underdog," Dick En-berg says. "Here comes Indiana State and this big blond guy and four chemistry majors. The argument was, they played in a minor league. Are they really that good? And they&#x2019;re matched up against the Big Ten power. Dramatically speaking, it was truth strangling fiction." </p><p>Bird&#x2019;s story strangled fiction by itself. Many people knew the skeletal details&#x2014;small-town farm boy drops out of Indiana University, spends a year working on a garbage truck, resurfaces at Indiana State, and leads the Sycamores through a storybook undefeated season&#x2014;but before the championship game, Indiana State had played on national television just three times. The 1979 NCAA final gave many Americans their first glimpse of Bird. "You didn&#x2019;t get to see everybody [on television] all the time. So in those days, it was a big treat when the tournament finally rolled around," says Bob Ryan, the longtime sportswriter for the <i>Boston Globe</i>. Bird&#x2019;s tight-lipped approach to the media only added to his allure. "There was just enough known about Bird and just enough unknown," says Lynn Henning, who was a columnist at Michigan State&#x2019;s hometown paper, the <i>State Journal</i>. "A little mystery goes a long way." </p><p>Bird was so underexposed that his roommate and teammate at Indiana State, Bob Heaton, would later say that up until the championship game he had friends in Denver (where Heaton had played before transferring to Indiana State) who thought Larry was black. This touches on another aspect of Bird&#x2019;s matchup with Magic that drew in the big audience. The two central protagonists were both highly skilled big men who wore the number 33, but the similarities ended there. Magic was black; Bird was white. Magic loved being the center of attention; Bird was painfully shy. Magic grew up in urban Lansing; Bird was the hick from French Lick. Magic played for the big state school in the high-profile Big Ten; Bird toiled in obscurity for the small college that competed in something called the Missouri Valley Conference. </p><p>Most of all, America tuned in to the 1979 NCAA championship game in record numbers because people understood that these two young men played a unique, exquisite style of basketball. It wasn&#x2019;t their physical gifts that drew folks in. Magic and Bird weren&#x2019;t especially quick or agile, and neither man would be a candidate for the high jump. Yet they were intense competitors and great thinkers on the court. Those qualities manifested themselves in the prettiest play of all: the pass. More than anything, Magic and Bird were great passers. They were truly something to see. </p><p>"Magic was a six-eight point guard and that was certainly unique, but it wasn&#x2019;t as if he was David Thompson. It wasn&#x2019;t as if he was Michael Jordan," says Dave Kindred, who covered the game for the <i>Washington Post</i>. "He succeeded because he knew how the game was played, and so did Bird. I&#x2019;m not going to deny they were great athletes or had great hand-eye coordination, but they weren&#x2019;t preternaturally gifted athletes. Watching them was watching basketball the way it should be played." </p><p>On that Monday evening, more than two thousand miles from where Indiana State and Michigan State were taking the court in Salt Lake City, the general counsel of the National Basketball Association was settling in front of a television in the living room of his home in Scars-dale, New York. The NBA was in the midst of a terrible season beset by sagging attendance, plummeting TV ratings, and the growing perception that white America would never buy in to a sport dominated by black players. David Stern wouldn&#x2019;t become the NBA&#x2019;s commissioner for another five years but, as he watched Magic and Bird go at it that night, he couldn&#x2019;t help but hope the pro game was about to get a badly needed boost. "We were very excited at the NBA that these two extraordinarily gifted athletes that were generating this much attention were coming our way," he says. </p><p>Some eighty miles northeast of Stern&#x2019;s home, a dozen or so ambitious, young wannabe television executives were wrapping up another long day of work in their cramped offices in Bristol, Connecticut. They had spent the day continuing their preparations for the launch of a new cable television venture, the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, which would soon be known as ESPN. The official launch date was September 7, and the channel&#x2019;s founder, Bill Rasmussen, had signed a deal a few weeks before with NCAA executive director Walter Byers to broadcast all the NCAA championship contests that were not being aired by one of the big three networks. The deal gave ESPN the rights to use NBC&#x2019;s feed of the early rounds of the NCAA tournament, beginning in 1980. "We kept telling ourselves, this time next year we&#x2019;re going to do the games leading up to this one," Rasmussen says. "Having a contract with the NCAA was huge to us at that point. Our network was really built on college basketball." </p><p>From his courtside seat at the scorer&#x2019;s table in Salt Lake City, Dave Gavitt sensed he was glimpsing into a bountiful future for the sport. Gavitt, the soft-spoken, whip-smart athletic director at Providence College, was serving his first season as a member of the NCAA men&#x2019;s basketball committee, and having participated in the NCAA&#x2019;s negotiations with ESPN, he understood better than most the potential that the emergence of cable television offered. Over the previous few months, Gavitt had secretly met with coaches and administrators from Georgetown University, St. John&#x2019;s University, and Syracuse University in hopes of convincing them to join Providence in a new basketball conference that would comprise schools located in the major television markets of the northeast. Gavitt did not realize how quickly his brainstorm would come to fruition&#x2014;the Big East would begin competing during the 1979&#x2013;80 season&#x2014;but as the Magic-Bird faceoff got under way, he sensed his idea was coming along at an opportune time. "Television had the ability to take something big and make it bigger," Gavitt says. "We felt like we were on the cusp of that with college basketball and the NCAA tournament." </p><p>As Stern, Rasmussen, and Gavitt watched the 1979 NCAA championship game, each was optimistic that it would have a positive impact on his own corner of the basketball world. But because they could not perceive all the external forces aligning that night, they could not fully comprehend what was really happening. </p><p>The game of basketball was about to change forever. </p><p>The 1979 NCAA championship game helped to catapult college basketball, and especially the NCAA tournament, into the national consciousness. In fact, the game kicked off a six-year stretch that could fairly be characterized as the golden era of the NCAA tournament. Between 1979 and 1985, the tournament introduced to the country six players who would dominate the NBA over the next two decades: Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Isiah Thomas, Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, and Hakeem Olajuwon. That period also included two of the greatest championship-game upsets in sports history: North Carolina State over Houston in 1983 and Villanova over Georgetown in 1985. </p><p>In 1979, the NCAA tournament was expanded to include forty teams (up from thirty-two the year before). The tournament was expanded twice more over the next five years&#x2014;to forty-eight teams in 1980 and to sixty-four in 1985. With the exception of the addition of the sixty-fifth team to accommodate an openi...</p></p><h2>The Only Thing That Matters: Book 2 in the Conversations with Humanity Series</h2><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something very unusual is occurring on this planet right now.

Gayle Lynds, who was compared to Ludlum after her 1996 debut, <i>Masquerade</i>, has two successful novels and a slew of pseudonymous pulp fiction titles to her credit. Together--after a fashion--they serve up book 1 of Ludlum's new Covert-One series of trade paperback originals, <i>Robert Ludlum's the Hades Factor</i>.<p> After three disparate Americans succumb to a hitherto unknown Ebola-like virus, the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) is pressed into service. Since the USAMRIID's top doc (and former military intelligence operative) Lt. Col. Jon Smith has yet to return from an overseas conference, the job of heading the medical research team falls to Smith's colleague and fianc�e, Dr. Sophia Russell.</p><p> Upon Smith's return, he is sequentially treated to a life-or-death warning from a childhood friend (and rogue FBI agent), several nasty near-death experiences, and the viscerally graphic demise of his wife-to-be, an apparent virus victim. Enraged and bereaved, Smith flies into investigatory action only to discover doctored files, expunged records, and the distinct likelihood that he's dealing with cases of murder-by-virus. As more questions are asked, more deaths occur, official channels slam shut, and Smith finds himself a wanted man, battling his best friend, an evil-genius gazillionaire scientist, corrupt politicians, and Third World terrorists. In other words, it's Smith versus all the usual suspects.</p><p> Ludlum and Lynds cover no new ground here (and their prose is less than sterling). In fact, <i>The Hades Factor</i> owes as much to Tom Clancy's Op-Center series--cocreated by Clancy and Steve Pieczenik--and Richard Preston's <i>The Hot Zone</i> as it does to Ludlum's own considerable body of work. That said, <i>The Hades Factor</i> still delivers a respectable level of intrigue and suspense, will likely be snapped up by output-starved Ludlum fanciers, and will be right at home on the bed stands of Preston fans. <i>--Michael Hudson</i></p><p>The #1 bestselling master of suspense and international intrigue continues to set the standard against which all other thrillers are measured with his expertly plotted, pulse-pounding Covert-One series.</p><p><b>ROBERT LUDLUM'S&#x2122;</b></p><p><b>THE HADES FACTOR</b></p><p>An unknown doomsday virus has claimed the lives of four people across the country&#x2015;including Dr. Sophia Russell, a research scientist working to understand the disease.

Nearly thirty years later&#x2014;during the summer of 2013&#x2014;New York&#x2019;s Central Park hosted a concert celebrating <i>3rd/Sister Lovers</i>, one of Alex&#x2019;s groundbreaking, yet commercially unsuccessful albums. The following night, the documentary <i>Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me</i> premiered in Manhattan, then opened around the country. Both events resulted in a flurry of Alex Chilton&#x2013;related Facebook exchanges, blogging, and media coverage. The Central Park performance marked the pinnacle of eight concerts over a thirty-month span organized by former Chilton collaborator Chris Stamey. In U.S. cities as well as around the world, participants ranged from members of R.E.M. and Wilco to Robyn Hitchcock and M. Ward. A few weeks later, some of Alex&#x2019;s noisiest acolytes, the Replacements, played their first gig in twenty-two years with their 1987 ode &#x201c;Alex Chilton&#x201d; now reaching an audience of fifty thousand, thanks to the internet.</p><p>For more than forty years, before his sudden death of a heart attack in March 2010, Alex Chilton touched three-plus generations of fans with his diverse musical legacy. He began his life in music in 1967 as a soulful-sounding teen idol before evolving into a brilliant songwriter and then punk provocateur in the 1970s. After a time in the wilderness&#x2014;driving cabs, washing dishes, trimming trees&#x2014;he became the revivified elder statesman of roots music and indie rock, from the mid-&#x2019;80s until his passing. Musician Chuck Prophet wrote of him, &#x201c;He defies categorization entirely. ENTIRELY. Isn&#x2019;t that rock &amp; roll? What rock &amp; roll was and should be all about?&#x201d;</p><p>Alex, though, was forever hell-bent on diverting attention from his artistic accomplishments and widening influence. Unimpressed with the laurels bestowed on him by music critics, alternative rockers, hipsters, and fans, Chilton carved out a sort of incognito life for himself in his adopted hometown of New Orleans.</p><p>Alex&#x2019;s passing at age fifty-nine sent shock waves of grief through the music world and the international media. His death was noted on the evening news, NPR, and in more than a hundred newspapers. The<i> New York Times</i> <i>Magazine</i> included him in their annual &#x201c;The Lives They Lived,&#x201d; in which Rob Hoerburger theorized, &#x201c;If one measure of rock stardom is being your own man, then Chilton, whose career was tracked with impurities, might have been the purest rock star of all.&#x201d; <i>Rolling Stone</i> had already placed his three Big Star recordings into its 2003 list of the greatest albums of all time, and <i>Spin</i>, in its 25th anniversary issue, said Chilton &#x201c;essentially invented indie and alternative rock.&#x201d; In the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Ann Powers reflected, &#x201c;Chilton wasn&#x2019;t just a genius writer of Beatles-inspired power pop songs. He was a lifelong epicurean and cultural adventurer who sought to brighten the corners of American popular music through his own work.&#x201d;</p><p>Alex died the same week Big Star was to perform at Austin&#x2019;s South by Southwest, the country&#x2019;s largest gathering of music cognoscenti. Those who knew him, not wanting to face the hard truth, considered the possibility that he&#x2019;d faked his demise to avoid the wide-eyed fandom he did not court. But just as it had during his life, his work shone despite the circumstances. Chilton pretty much stole the eighty-thousand-strong conference, with artists ranging from Ray Davies to John Hiatt, Courtney Love to Cheap Trick eulogizing him on various stages. A packed tribute concert became a cathartic, makeshift memorial for the reluctant iconoclast, a rainy parade of indie-rock luminaries. &#x201c;A procession of guest musicians helped underscore both the timeless beauty of Chilton&#x2019;s best songs and the wide-ranging influence his music had across different genres and generations,&#x201d; reported the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>. More memorial concerts followed, in Memphis, New York, Los Angeles, Nashville, New Orleans, Chapel Hill, and other college towns where his trio had played small clubs off and on for twenty years. No doubt, Alex Chilton would have been bemused by all this attention, perhaps annoyed that once again his story is spun regardless of his will.</p><p>Music was Alex&#x2019;s life&#x2014;but what he loved more than making music was doing it on his own terms. As former <i>Washington Post</i> writer Joe Sasfy put it, &#x201c;He [was] always riveting and real in ways few performers can ever risk. And it is those risks, in life and art, that separate Chilton from all that he has spawned.&#x201d;</p><p>Falling into the music business as lead singer of the Box Tops at age sixteen, with no plan to be famous, he went on to make beautiful, sometimes harrowing music with Big Star&#x2014;the group the term &#x201c;cult band&#x201d; personifies&#x2014;and then became an iconoclastic solo artist, wandering in uncharted territory. In titling his 1995 album <i>A Man Called Destruction</i>&#x2014;his last solo release filled with mostly his own songs&#x2014;he acknowledged that he had often torn up the paths he&#x2019;d taken before, wiping out the footprints, starting anew. As his longtime compadre Tav Falco said, &#x201c;Alex&#x2019;s process was to create something that&#x2019;s beautiful, then the next stage was to destroy it.&#x201d; Alex continued to use his singular voice as a stylist of songcraft from all genres, while forging ahead as a guitarist, becoming an excellent, imaginative player&#x2014;&#x201c;the Thelonious Monk of rhythm guitar,&#x201d; according to Tom Waits.</p><p>&#x201c;All my career,&#x201d; Alex said in 1993, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always kind of envied somebody like the Cramps [whom he produced], who had such a well-defined bag they were in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I guess I was wishing I wanted to be that way or something. But I don&#x2019;t, really, and now I don&#x2019;t wish for it anymore, either.&#x201d;</p><p>During the last decade of his life, in his beloved cottage in New Orleans&#x2019;s Treme, he enjoyed playing a piano he bought with a check from <i>That &#x2019;70s Show</i>, which put his &#x201c;In the Street&#x201d; into international circulation as the series&#x2019; theme song. Alex had grown up listening to his father&#x2019;s jazz on the family&#x2019;s Chickering, so this simple pleasure brought him full circle. Leading an eclectic trio for nearly twenty-five years, he relished presenting an endless variety of songs&#x2014;including those from his childhood and his earliest repertoire as a teenager. His longtime drummer Richard Dworkin remembers that, as they toured America together, Alex liked to find his way without using a map, driving from town to town. Though he might choose some circuitous routes, he usually found his way, pulling up to the club just in time for the gig. As in life, Alex liked traveling the byways, even if it meant getting lost sometimes. It wasn&#x2019;t an easy road&#x2014;but it took him where he wanted to go.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>The Chiltons of Virginia and Mississippi</p><p>William Alexander Chilton came from well-bred, aristocratic stock. When he reached fifty, Alex took a keen interest in his illustrious family history, tracing his lineage back to the seventeenth century, when a Chilton left England for the New World. Alex proudly corrected one journalist who thought the Chiltons emigrated from England in the 1700s, telling him that it was actually 1660 when John Chilton sailed to America. Yet after this account of the Chilton family was published, Alex cut off communication with its author for the sin of including the Chilton genealogy. Ambivalent about his pedigree, Alex both embraced it and disowned it. At various times, traveling to visit ancestral burial plots, he relished his forebears&#x2019; accomplishments; at others, such a patrician genetic code contradicted his self-image as a working-class musician, the kind who once said he wanted his gravestone to read SELF-MADE MAN. Such dichotomies would dog Alex Chilton his entire life.</p><p>The &#x201c;Chiltons of Virginia,&#x201d; described in a 1907 <i>William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine</i>, were &#x201c;descended from an old English family, originally of French descent as the name indicates&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [perhaps] derived from the Chalk Cliffs of Dover, near which the Chiltons are supposed to have settled on their first landing upon English shores.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In 1060 William of Normandy set sail for the conquest of England, and inscribed on his banner roll was the name of Sir John Chilton. This is the first mention we have of the name.&#x201d;</p><p>In 1660 another John Chilton, possibly of Canterbury, emigrated to America to settle on land grants (bestowed to loyal subjects by King Charles II) in Lancaster County, Virginia; he added to his holdings by acquiring land in Westmoreland County. His son John Chilton II, like his father a planter, remained in the northern neck of Virginia, on the banks of the Potomac River, in an area he called Currioman, the name of a neighboring creek that flowed into the Potomac. This part of Virginia became the seat of several wealthy families, including the Chiltons, whose tobacco plantations were manned by slave labor. The Chiltons, continuously buying more land, thrived in Virginia for more than four generations. The present-day hamlet of Chiltons, Virginia&#x2014;once part of the Currioman estate&#x2014;was named for the family.</p><p>Continuing the line to Alex&#x2019;s direct descendants, John II&#x2019;s youngest son, Thomas Chilton, inherited his father&#x2019;s plantation. He served as justice of the peace, sheriff, church warden, and major in the foot companies of Westmoreland County. At the time of his death, records show he owned sixty-two slaves.</p><p>Thomas&#x2019;s son William participated in a major event precipitating the American Revolution. In 1765 he and other Virginians opposed to Britain&#x2019;s new Stamp Act formed the first public association to resist the recently imposed tariff on printed paper. William and three other Chiltons were among those signing a document, later known as the Westmoreland Protest, denouncing the Stamp Act. Though William died on the eve of the American Revolution, his brothers Thomas, Charles, and John served in the War of Independence.</p><p>In 1840 John Marshall Chilton, William&#x2019;s grandson, born in December 1815, moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how my branch of the Chilton family got to Mississippi and stayed there until two years before I was born,&#x201d; Alex once related. A prominent attorney and an influential citizen in affairs of church and state, the Honorable John Marshall Chilton married Sarah Norton, of a distinguished, religious family in New Orleans. Sarah&#x2019;s father, Charles N. Norton, had been appointed marshal of the state of Mississippi by John Quincy Adams in 1824. Norton, to whom James Madison had given a letter of introduction with which to travel abroad in 1806, was a professor and later president of Jefferson College in Washington, Mississippi.</p><p>Before the Civil War, the John Marshall Chilton family lived on a large cotton plantation with numerous slaves. There John wrote a history of the colonial Mississippi territory (which Alex once said made for &#x201c;pretty good reading&#x201d;). In 1859, not long after a journey to Minnesota, Chilton died from unknown causes at age forty-three; his fourteen-year-old son, Charles, a prodigious correspondent, wrote his Aunt Dory, &#x201c;It is hard to bear this sudden seperation [sic] from Pa; but grieving cannot bring him back; and we must therefore endeavor to be reconciled to our hard lot.&#x201d;</p><p>John Marshall Chilton&#x2019;s younger brother, Robert Hall Chilton, graduated from the U.S. Military Academy and served in the Mexican-American War, during which he rescued Jefferson Davis at the Battle of Buena Vista. In 1861 Major Chilton joined the Confederate Army, where he became chief of staff under General Robert E. Lee. After the war he settled in Columbus, Georgia, where he became president of a manufacturing company. His son Robert Lee Chilton married Sydney Norton Chilton, his first paternal cousin and the daughter of the Honorable John Chilton. Alex&#x2019;s grandfather Howard Sidney Chilton may have been named after her.</p><p>Alex, no doubt, was dismayed that his ancestors fought for the South in the Civil War. He was known to deride Confederate heroes; as he once said to a friend, &#x201c;I hope your street isn&#x2019;t named after the vicious war criminal/genocidal racist Nathan Bedford [Forrest]. How are these honors for these monsters allowed to continue?&#x201d; Another time, while performing in Athens, Georgia, he blurted out, &#x201c;The South sucks! All those clich�s about our racism and sleaziness are true!&#x201d;</p><p>Alex may have felt more sympathy for John Marshall Chilton&#x2019;s son Charles, who attended boarding school in Virginia prior to the war and became known as kind and generous toward the former slaves who continued to work on his family&#x2019;s estate near Clinton, Mississippi. Charles wrote his grandmother in 1866, &#x201c;Things go on much as usual here, nothing to break the monotony of the week, except an occasional quarrel with some freedmen. I however have so far gotten along swimmingly with them, and have no reason to complain.&#x201d;</p><p>Nine years later, however, Charles would fall victim to the turbulent period of Reconstruction. In September 1875 Democrats and Republicans were vying for votes in the upcoming November legislature election, with candidates organizing gatherings for their black and white constituents. On September 4 a picnic was held in a grove about a quarter mile from Charles Chilton&#x2019;s home. Candidates from both parties gave speeches to an audience comprising sixty to seventy-five whites (Democrats and Republicans) and approximately a thousand to twelve hundred black Republicans. As the speechmaking ended, an altercation broke out between whites and blacks, guns were fired from both sides, and a melee erupted. During the ensuing violence, six blacks and three whites were shot and killed, at the picnic and in the neighboring cotton fields. The mob raced from the scene on horseback and on foot. When Charles Chilton, hearing what had happened, ran to his front gate to usher his hired hands into safety, a black man galloping by on a horse shot him in the back with a Winchester.</p><p>At a subsequent inquiry, reported nationally as the &#x201c;Clinton Riot,&#x201d; it was determined that &#x201c;Chilton met his death while endeavoring to protect the colored women and children, and had handed his gun to a colored man in his employ at the time he received his death wound. Chilton was well liked, well thought of by his neighbors and friends. A young man of fine family.&#x201d; (After the killings, a vigilante group of whites took revenge, murdering a dozen black residents of the county.)</p><p>Charles&#x2019;s mother, Sarah Norton Chilton, described the tragedy in a September 17, 1875, letter to her sister in New Orleans:</p><p>He died in the arms of his brother John. I was three miles distant from him and had to go all the way through an infuriated mob&#x2014;with no one but a negro&#x2014;in order to bid him farewell. It seems to me like a thousand years since then. I never have looked upon any human face so beautifully peaceful as was his dear dear face. He said in every look, &#x201c;All is well.&#x201d; The country is in a sad state of excitement&#x2014;men never take off their weapons except when they go to bed and there they sleep on th...</p></p><h2>Stalin&#39;s Curse: Battling for Communism in War and Cold War</h2><p><p>A chilling, riveting account based on newly released Russian documentation that reveals Joseph Stalin&#x2019;s true motives&#x2014;and the extent of his enduring commitment to expanding the Soviet empire&#x2014;during the years in which he seemingly collaborated with Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and the capitalist West.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>At the Big Three conferences of World War II, Stalin persuasively played the role of a great world leader. Even astute observers like George F. Kennan concluded that the United States and Great Britain should view Stalin as a modern-day tsarist-like figure whose primary concerns lay in international strategy and power politics, not in ideology. Now Robert Gellately uses recently uncovered documents to make clear that, in fact, the dictator was an unwavering revolutionary merely biding his time, determined as ever to establish Communist regimes across Europe and beyond, and that his actions during these years (and the poorly calculated Western responses) set in motion what would eventually become the Cold War. Gellately takes us behind the scenes. We see the dictator disguising his political ambitions and prioritizing the future of Communism, even as he pursued the war against Hitler. Along the way, the ascetic dictator&#x2019;s Machiavellian moves and bouts of irrationality kept the Western leaders on their toes, in a world that became more dangerous and divided year by year.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Exciting, deeply engaging, and shrewdly perceptive, <i>Stalin&#x2019;s Curse</i> is an unprecedented revelation of the sinister machinations of the Soviet dictator.</p></p><p>Robert Gellately is the Earl Ray Beck Professor of History at Florida State University and recently was the Bertelsmann Visiting Professor of Twentieth-Century Jewish Politics and History at Oxford University. He is the author of <i>Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe; The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy, 1933&#x2013;1945;</i> and <i>Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany</i>. His work has been translated into more than twenty languages.<p>Chapter 1: Making the Stalinist Revolution<br> &nbsp;<br> Stalin was not the heir apparent when Lenin died in 1924. But within five years if not before, he was virtually the undisputed leader. A decade later he was the all-powerful dictator and creature of the Stalinist revolution, an extraordinary experiment in socialism. In his own lifetime he became a godlike figure, one to whom even the proudest comrade, wrongfully indicted by the Stalinist system, could willingly offer himself up for the cause. How was this possible? Here we will begin to put the pieces together and try to understand the emergence of Stalin, who became the Leader, Boss, or Master of the Kremlin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Impatient for Communism: <br> &nbsp;<br> Lenin&#x2019;s leadership was marked by bouts of illness, overwork, and strain, and from mid-1921 his health rapidly deteriorated, with a series of strokes beginning the following year. The question of who would take his place was uppermost in everyone&#x2019;s mind. Lenin was not exactly helpful in his political &#x201c;testament&#x201d;&#x2014;two short notes he dictated to his secretary in December 1922. In those last words to his comrades, he worried about a &#x201c;split&#x201d; in the party and had negative things to say about all the leadership contenders. In a postscript dictated just over a week later (January 4, 1923), he said that Stalin was &#x201c;too rude&#x201d; and expressed the view that someone else might make a better general secretary.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, it would be a mistake to believe that Lenin wanted to exclude a bad choice for party leader and that, had he managed to get rid of Stalin, the Soviet Union would have been saved from a monster. In fact, until nearly the end, he trusted Stalin more than anyone and never mentioned removing him from the powerful Politburo or Central Committee. Stalin&#x2019;s &#x201c;offense&#x201d; was to slight Lenin&#x2019;s wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, for not following doctors&#x2019; orders to stop her sick husband from dictating work.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the course of Lenin&#x2019;s illness, Stalin and his two weaker partners, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, formed an informal alliance (troika) in the Politburo. It was in place when Lenin died on January 24, 1924, and soon made its presence felt. In this alliance, Stalin&#x2019;s &#x201c;ruling style,&#x201d; insofar as he had one, was collegial. By no means did he have everything his own way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arguably, the most powerful man in the country on Lenin&#x2019;s death was Leon Trotsky, the famed people&#x2019;s commissar for military affairs. However, Trotsky made careless mistakes, such as convalescing in the south and thus missing the great man&#x2019;s funeral. It did not matter that Stalin had misled him about the date of that event. Moreover, in early 1924 the ruling troika leaked old documents showing that back in 1913 Trotsky had said horrible things about Lenin. Nor did Trotsky help himself when he said that the country would not accept him as leader because of his &#x201c;Jewish origins.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Next in line were Zinoviev and Kamenev, who were also Jewish. Their major failing was opposition to Lenin&#x2019;s decision to go for power in October 1917. Then there was the younger and dazzling Nikolai Bukharin, who, Lenin had thought, might not be &#x201c;Marxist enough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Although Stalin&#x2019;s record was mixed, his policies, which had once distanced him from many party members, were now beginning to make sense to them. He had stood almost alone in opposition to Trotsky&#x2019;s goal of speeding up the spread of Communist revolution. Then several such plans to foment revolution in Germany went badly wrong, and Stalin&#x2019;s criticism of the strategy gained traction. In the aftermath of the failed 1923 effort in Germany, the Soviet party generally moved to his side.<br> &nbsp;<br> Along with troika partners Zinoviev and Kamenev, Stalin acted through the Central Committee to put mild pressure on Trotsky, who resigned early in the new year as people&#x2019;s commissar for military affairs. Trotsky said that he had tired of the insinuations, though by quitting he left the field to his enemies. When in due course Zinoviev and Kamenev began challenging Stalin&#x2019;s apparent readiness to abandon the long-standing commitment to revolution in Europe, the future dictator switched alliances and linked up with Bukharin (then only thirty-three), and the new duo soon emerged in control of the Politburo.<br> &nbsp;<br> The two friends differed on some important issues. Bukharin embraced the economic theory and political philosophy of the New Economic Policy (NEP), introduced by Lenin back in 1921, when agricultural production was down to 60 percent of its pre-1914 levels. The NEP indicated that the Communists had to &#x201c;retreat&#x201d; because the country was in turmoil and desperation. It introduced a proportional tax on peasants, who were then allowed to sell privately any surplus that remained. This sliver of freedom gave agricultural production a boost, and by 1926 under the NEP the reforms were working. But the economy soon entered &#x201c;a real, systemic crisis&#x201d; because of the demands made on it. Stalin came out strongly against the NEP, and in what would amount to a second Russian revolution, he advocated a planned economy based on the collectivization and modernization of agriculture. The promise was that this approach would feed the country better and also, through a &#x201c;regime of the strictest economy,&#x201d; allow for the accumulation of surplus funds to finance industry. Ultimately, these five-year plans strove to convert the Soviet Union into an industrial and military giant.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thus, Stalin and his supporters opted to restart the revolution that Lenin had postponed, but it took time to decide on the exact course. In his speeches and articles during 1925, Stalin began to identify himself with the &#x201c;unorthodox&#x201d; Marxist view that &#x201c;socialism in one country&#x201d; was possible. As usual when he innovated, he invoked Lenin&#x2019;s name and liberally quoted him.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the Fourteenth Party Congress (December 1925), Stalin was solemn while giving the conclusion to his political report. Workers in capitalist countries, upon seeing the Soviet successes, he said, would gain &#x201c;confidence in their own strength,&#x201d; and the rise in worker consciousness would be the beginning of the end of capitalism. In this scenario, as the Soviets created socialism at home, far from giving up on the international proletarian revolution, they were providing a model to inspire the workers of the world. His words were followed by thunderous applause.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, by 1927 food shortages and high unemployment demanded action. In January of the next year Stalin, Bukharin, and others in the Politburo decided on &#x201c;emergency measures,&#x201d; a euphemism for expropriation campaigns in the countryside. Stalin directed top officials, including Anastas Mikoyan, Lazar Kaganovich, and Andrei Zhdanov&#x2014;all of them his firm backers&#x2014;to designated parts of the country. He went off by train to the Urals and Siberia, where agricultural deliveries to the state were down, even though the harvest was good. He learned that the peasants preferred selling to private traders, who paid more. At each stop he browbeat officials into using Article 107 of the criminal code (on withholding grain) to prosecute these kulaks (the more affluent peasants) and other &#x201c;speculators.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Stalin returned to Moscow, Bukharin questioned these brutal &#x201c;excesses.&#x201d; However, for Stalin the trip east deepened his determination to solve the agricultural problem; it convinced him more than ever that peasant cultivation of small plots had to end and that collectivization was the ultimate solution. In all his years as leader, this was his only visit to the collective farms. Mostly he knew them only as abstractions, like chess pieces to be moved around.<br> &nbsp;<br> Scarcity of food worsened in 1928 and into 1929, the result of poor harvests in some places, though the main reason was that the state offered too little in payment for grain. However, anyone who suggested giving the peasants more for their crops, as did Bukharin, was attacked as a &#x201c;right deviationist,&#x201d; because they appeared to be leaning toward a market economy. Stalin berated Bukharin for saying the kulaks would &#x201c;grow into socialism&#x201d; and instead affirmed that the accumulated wealth generated by peasants on collective farms would be taken as &#x201c;tribute.&#x201d; It would finance the industrial development of the country and the five-year plans. And it did not matter in the slightest that shortly before, he had scorned precisely such an approach as exploiting the peasants.<br> &nbsp;<br> In April 1929, addressing the Central Committee, Stalin reiterated that the main idea of the first five-year -plan&#x2014;already being implemented&#x2014;was not merely to increase production but &#x201c;to guarantee the socialist sector of the economy.&#x201d; Now he ridiculed Bukharin&#x2019;s suggestion to incentivize peasants with higher prices so that they would deliver more to the state. That heresy, he believed, would raise the cost of bread in the cities; worse, it would strengthen &#x201c;capitalist elements&#x201d; in the countryside.<br> &nbsp;<br> According to Stalin&#x2019;s theory, these &#x201c;last elements&#x201d; were the problem, and he postulated that as socialism grew stronger, better-off peasants like the kulaks would struggle harder than ever because no dying class in history ever gave up without a final desperate fight. Bukharin thought it &#x201c;strange&#x201d; to point to an &#x201c;inevitable law&#x201d; that the more the Soviet Union advanced toward socialism, the more class warfare would intensify. Then, &#x201c;at the gates of socialism, we either have to start a civil war or waste away from hunger and drop dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevertheless, Stalin&#x2019;s arguments prevailed, and the first five-year plan was adopted at the Sixteenth Party Conference, which began on April 23, 1929. The plan called for nothing less than a second Russian revolution, encapsulated by the collectivization of agriculture, industrialization, and the transformation of culture. It set astronomical quotas, targeting agriculture to grow by 55 percent and industry by 136 percent.<br> &nbsp;<br> Obtaining these results and getting what was needed from the countryside was a massive and complex undertaking involving state agencies, the directors of factories and collective farms, workers, and peasants. Stalin expected that some or all of them would try to get around the system, and his inclination was to use force as needed. Part of the revolution, therefore, would involve extending state control&#x2014;which fell off dramatically outside the bigger cities.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the twelfth anniversary of the Russian Revolution in 1929&#x2014;celebrated, as customary, on November 7&#x2014;Stalin published a key article on the &#x201c;year of the great turn&#x201d; (perelom). Today historians call this the beginning of Stalin&#x2019;s revolution from above. In typically militarized language, he reminded everyone that Lenin had regarded the NEP as only a tactical &#x201c;retreat,&#x201d; after which there would be a run-up and then &#x201c;a great leap forward.&#x201d; The party had already launched &#x201c;a successful offensive against the capitalist elements,&#x201d; the early results showed; &#x201c;we are advancing rapidly along the path of -industrialization&#x2014;to socialism, leaving behind the age-old &#x2018;Russian&#x2019; backwardness.&#x201d; Notwithstanding this official optimism, out in the countryside the peasantry was resisting the imposition of a system worse than they had known under the tsars. In 1929 the government had to resort to mass arrests, and the next year there were &#x201c;disturbances&#x201d; involving up to 2.4 million people. Police and brigades from the city clashed with peasants unwilling to surrender their harvests.<br> &nbsp;<br> Moscow insisted that the resistance was led by kulaks, particularly in Ukraine, where nationalist sentiment was strong. In a speech to Marxist students on December 27, Stalin announced the ominous-sounding policy of &#x201c;eliminating the kulaks as a class.&#x201d; &#x201c;To launch an offensive against the kulaks,&#x201d; he said, was to prepare and then &#x201c;to strike so hard as to prevent them from again rising to their feet. That is what we Bolsheviks call a real offensive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At Stalin&#x2019;s urging, on January 30 in the new year, a commission led by longtime henchman Vyacheslav Molotov produced a far-reaching decree. It divided the kulaks into three categories, with appropriate punishments. The &#x201c;first category&#x201d; included any family of the top 3 to 5 percent of the peasants in each district. An astonishing initial execution target was 60,000 heads of these families. Quotas were also set for &#x201c;category two&#x201d; and &#x201c;category three&#x201d; kulaks, with instructions about how their land was to be taken and where they were to be sent. The strategy was like a military operation. In fact, that was how chief of the secret police (OGPU) Genrikh G. Yagoda spoke of it to his paladins. He worried only about &#x201c;avoiding losses&#x201d; of his men.<br> &nbsp;<br> In some places no one was well off enough to be labeled a kulak. Villagers met to decide who would be sacrificed or drew lots. Some avaricious neighbors denounced as &#x201c;kulaks&#x201d; people whose goods, lands, or women they coveted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Families branded as kulaks lost everything and were deported to &#x201c;special settlements&#x201d; (spetsposelenie). Trains rumbled eastward for weeks and often dumped their cargo in completely uninhabitable places, resulting in starvation, disease, even cannibalism. In 1930 and 1931, no less than 381,026 families, or 1.8 million people, were forced out. It is difficult to be certain about the death toll, though estimates range into the hundreds of thousands. And the process continued into the next year.</p></p><h2>Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana</h2><p>Nirvana came out of nowhere in 1991 to sell nearly nine million copies of the landmark album Nevermind, whose thunderous sound and indelible melodies embodied the confusion, frustration and passion of the emerging Generation X. Hailed by Q magazine as one of the greatest music biographies of all time, Come As You Are is the up-close, intimate story of Nirvana., with exclusive in-depth interviews with band members Kurt Cobain, Chris Novoselic and Dave Grohl, as well as friends, relatives, former band members and associates. A final chapter details the last year of Kurt Cobain&#39;s life. From their early days in rural Aberdeen, Washington, to their domination of the world music scene in the early 90&#39;s, Come As You Are tells the Nirvana story as no other book does, candidly and first-hand: the allegations of heroin use; the soul-crushing pressures of sudden success; the burden of their unasked-for role as spokesman for a generation; and the tragic spiral that culminated in Kurt Cobain&#39;s suicide in April 1994. With close analyses of every song on each of the band&#39;s three major albums, a comprehensive discography and more than one hundred rare and never before-seen photographs, posters and original lyric sheets, Come As You Are is by far the most intimate look ever at one of rock&#39;s most influential and significant groups.</p><p>My favorite book about Nirvana. For one thing, it doesn't sensationalize, but it doesn't gloss anything over. Having been active in the Seattle music scene throughout Nirvana's obscurity, fame, and demise, I can vouch for the accuracy of its description of the music community in the late '80s and early '90s and Nirvana's role. And being in a band that's currently climbing the ladder, I appreciated the many lessons this book has to offer about the workings of the recording industry. <p> Best of all, because this book was written before Cobain's death, it is not tinged with the "isn't this tragic" attitude that permeates many books about Nirvana and Cobain. Instead, the book is vibrant with the energy, excitement, and passion that swept local musicians the day "Nevermind" was released, local audiences in the months after, the U.S, and--lest we forget--the world, during Nirvana's more-than-15-minutes of fame.</p>Nirvana came out of nowhere in 1991 to sell nearly five million copies of their landmark album <i>Nevermind</i>, whose thunderous sound and indelible melodies embodied all the confusion, frustration, and passion of the emerging Generation X. <i>Come As You Are</i> is the close-up, intimate story of Nirvana -- the <i>only</i> book with exclusive in-depth interviews with bandmembers Kurt Cobain, Krist Noveselic, and Dave Grohl, as well as friends, relatives, former bandmembers, and associates -- now updated to include a new final chapter detailing the last year of Kurt Cobain's life, before his tragic suicide in April 1994.<p> "Amazingly raw and candid... <i>Come As You Are</i> is as good as rock bios get" -- <i>Billboard</i>.</p></p><h2>The Way of the SEAL: Think Like An Elite Warrior to Lead and Succeed</h2><p>Blending the tactics he learned from America&#x2019;s elite force with lessons from the Spartans, samurai, Apache scouts, and other great warrior traditions, Mark Divine has distilled the fundamentals of success into eight powerful principles that will transform you into the leader you always knew you could be.

In this brief but dense introduction, one of the foremost scholars on Sufism opens up the tradition of the Sufis themselves. While many introductions to Sufism reveal only the "intoxicated" Sufism of paradoxical parables and poets drunken with love for God, Sufism is also balanced by a sober side. William Chittick presents both sides, touching on the major beliefs and practices of Sufis through the ages. What distinguishes Chittick's work is that he draws directly from his vast knowledge of original Sufi writings. He introduces us to Arabic terms, which if merely translated into English would mislead the reader. Instead, he describes the nuances of a few key terms that deliver the reader beyond our usual understanding and into the minds and hearts of Sufi mystics, philosophers, and theologians. Chittick's writing can be difficult, tossing off words like "supererogatory" and "deracinated," but a patient reading will reward you with an understanding of the subtlety and dynamism that Sufism brings to the Islamic tradition. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>William C.

She lives with her husband and two energetic children in the Pacific Northwest outside Tacoma,Washington.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>Scotland, 1355</p> <p>Morrigan McNab silently drew her short sword, careful to remain hidden from the road. She checked to ensure her black head-scarf was in place, concealing her nose and mouth. The target of today's villainy clopped toward them through the thick mud. Twelve men were in the mounted party, their rich robes identifying them as wealthy, above the common concerns of daily sustenance... in other words, perfect marks.</p> <p>Concealed by the tree and thick foliage, Morrigan scanned the approaching party for weapons. It appeared to be a hunting party, since all had bows slung across their backs and long knives at their sides. The dead boar they carried strung between two riders was also a clear sign of a hunt. Despite their alarming arsenal, most looked complacent, paying more attention to the flask they were passing around as they laughed and joked among themselves. One man, the one carrying a metal-tipped pike, scanned the woods around him as if he sensed danger.</p> <p>Morrigan glanced at her brother Archie, only his eyes visible over the mask he wore. He pointed to her, then to the man with the pike. Morrigan narrowed her eyes at her brother. He always gave her the hard ones. Morrigan gave a curt nod and turned her focus back to the pikeman. He looked fit and vigilant. She preferred fat and careless. The war horse was a fine specimen too, tall and strong, trained to stand his ground in battle. It would not be easy to take him down.</p> <p>The hunting party clomped closer, and a man walking behind the riders came into view. Morrigan wondered why he was left to slog through the mud behind the hunting party. Many of the horses would carry two men with ease. The walking man was dressed in a worn traveling cloak and a brightly colored tunic with a lyre strapped to his back. He must be a minstrel. Those wealthy hunters probably considered him unworthy of a ride. Damn rich bastards.</p> <p>Archie gave a bird call, the signal. Morrigan tensed in anticipation, coiled, ready to strike, and counted. The men jumped at twenty; she always leaped at nineteen.</p> <p>Morrigan sprung onto the road and charged the man with the pike, screeching like some fey creature from hell. Archie and the men surged into the fray, the men's shouts blending with the surprised cries of the beset hunting party. The pikeman lowered his weapon toward her with a snarl, but Morrigan dropped to the ground and rolled under the nicely trained war horse, which was obliging enough not to move.</p> <p>Regaining her feet on the other side of the horse, she pounded the hilt of her sword into the man's elbow that held the pike, which now was pointed the wrong direction. The man howled in pain, his black teeth showing, and swung to hit her. She anticipated the move, ducked out of the way, grabbed the pike, and flipped it out of his hand. She had her sword tip stuck under the edge of his hauberk before the pike sunk into the mud. She applied just enough pressure to give him pause.</p> <p>Her fellow bandits had likewise subdued the rest of the party. It was quiet for a moment, an odd silence after the explosion of sounds a moment before, that terrified both man and beast into mute submission.</p> <p>"Good afternoon, my fellow travelers." Archie McNab stood before the hunting party, a scarf covering his nose and mouth. He gave a practiced bow with an added flourish. Morrigan rolled her eyes. Her brother liked to think of himself as a gentleman thief. True, he was laird of his clan, but Morrigan had little tolerance for petty niceties. They were there to rob them. What was the point of being genteel about it?</p> <p>"I see ye are burdened wi' the evils o' worldly possessions. But ne'er fear, my brethren, we have come to relieve ye o' yer burdens."</p> <p>Morrigan held out her free hand, hoping the man would readily hand over his pouch of coins like the other wide-eyed members of his party. He did not comply and instead nudged his horse, causing it to step sideways.</p> <p>"Grab the reins," Morrigan commanded a young accomplice. The lad took up the reins of the war horse and held the animal's head while Morrigan kept her eyes and her sword on the black-toothed man. He snarled at the lad, who balked and stepped back.</p> <p>"Hold its head!" Morrigan snapped. The last thing she needed was this man making trouble.</p> <p>"Now if ye fine gentlemen will make a small donation to the fund for wayward highwaymen, we shall set ye on yer way in a trifle," said Archie.</p> <p>On foot, Morrigan mentally added. The warhorse Black Tooth sat upon was a fine specimen. She reckoned she would look better than he astride such a fine animal. The rest of the hunting party readily handed over their money pouches and weapons, but not Black Tooth. He glared a silent challenge. Morrigan sighed. For once, just for the novelty of it all, she'd like things to be easy. It was not to be on that day. Nor any day, truth be told.</p> <p>Morrigan stabbed her mark harder, but other than a scowl, he made no move to comply. She could kill the man, but Archie was firm in his orders not to kill unless necessary, and Morrigan had to acknowledge the wisdom of it. Robbing folks was one thing, murder was another. The last thing they needed was a band of Highlanders come to rid the forest of murderous thieves.</p> <p>The man still refused to hand over his money bag, so Morrigan grabbed the pommel of his saddle with her free hand and put her foot on his in the stirrup and hoisted herself up. It should have been a quick move. She grabbed his purse and pulled it free. Suddenly, he shouted and kicked the horse. The lad dropped the reins and the horse lunged forward, throwing Morrigan off balance. One punch from Black Tooth, and Morrigan fell back into the mud.</p> <p>The black-toothed terror charged the horse in front of him, causing the mount to spook and rear. The result was chaos, as the remaining horses broke free, urged on by the hunting party who sensed a chance to break free.</p> <p>"Grab the horses, ye fools!" Morrigan jumped up shouting. "They be unarmed, get them ye bastards!"</p> <p>But more than one thief, having secured the desired reward, melted back into the shrubbery rather than face the angry hunters. The hunting party broke free and galloped away down the path they had come.</p> <p>"Damnation!" Morrigan yelled at her thieving brethren. "What is wrong wi' ye cowardly knaves?"</p> <p>"We got the coin," grumbled one man in response.</p> <p>"But not the horses, ye fool! Now they can ride for their friends and come back for us. And ye," Morrigan turned on the spindly legged lad who had dropped the leads of the warhorse she coveted. "Ye ought to be more afeared o' me than any bastard on a horse." Morrigan strode toward the boy with the intent of teaching a lesson that would be long remembered, but her brother caught her arm.</p> <p>"Let him be, he's only a lad."</p> <p>"I was younger than that when I joined this game," Morrigan shot back.</p> <p>"Aye," Archie leaned to whisper in her ear. "But we all canna be heartless bitches like ye." With teasing eyes he straightened and said in a louder voice. "Besides, we have a guest."</p> <p>Standing in the middle of the muddy road was the colorfully dressed man with a lyre slung on his back. Damn hunters had left him with a bunch of thieves. Morrigan cursed them once again along with their offspring and their poor mothers for general completeness. She was nothing if not thorough.</p> <p>Despite being surrounded by thieves, the man appeared surprisingly calm, though perhaps after their pathetic display of incompetence he rightly felt he had nothing to fear.</p> <p>"Allow me to introduce myself," the stranger said with a seductive French accent and an equally appealing smile. "I am Jacques, poor traveling minstrel. At your service." He gave a polished bow that put Archie's attempts at gallantry to shame. Morrigan caught her brother's eye to make sure he knew she had noted it.</p> <p>"And what brings ye to be traveling with such cowardly companions that they would leave ye at the first sight of trouble?" Morrigan asked.</p> <p>"The hunters I met on the road. They invited me to walk behind them to their hunting lodge." Jacques gave an impish grin. "I can only assume my services, they are no longer required."</p> <p>"Ah, then they are doubly fools, for a minstrel is a rare prize indeed," said Archie.</p> <p>"You mean for me to be ransomed?"</p> <p>"Nay, nay, ye are our guest. We are but humble thieves, but we shall take ye to..." Archie swallowed what he was going to say and coughed. "We shall take ye to the doorstep o' the great Laird McNab. We dare no' cross the border o' his domain, for he has no tolerance for our kind, but I am sure he will welcome ye. And he can pay for yer services," said Archie McNab, jingling his ill-gotten gains.</p> <p>"Archie," hissed Morrigan drawing him aside. "What are ye doing? We canna bring him back to our hall."</p> <p>"Nay, we will drop him close and let him walk the rest," whispered Archie in response. "Then we will ride ahead and wait for his arrival. We are still masked, so he canna identify us as McNabs."</p> <p>"But he has certainly heard us, Brother. Do ye no' ken he will recognize our voices?"</p> <p>"Nay, nay, ye worrit yerself. Think, Morrigan. When was the last time we had a minstrel?" Archie's eyes gleamed above his mask.</p> <p>Morrigan shook her head. It had been a long, long time. And for good reason. What minstrel in his right mind would travel into the Highlands to sing for the poorest clan west of Edinburgh? It was a tempting opportunity, and Morrigan knew all too well the devious gleam in Archie's eyes. They would soon be hosting the clan's first minstrel in twenty years.</p> <p>Archie gave some rapid commands. The men, quick to see a potential reward, eagerly complied, gathering the weapons, money, and the dead boar. The minstrel appeared to be a pleasant sort of man, making no complaints and readily agreeing to the plan of taking him near the "great Laird McNab." Morrigan wondered at the shocking hubris that would lead to that bold lie. Her brother always dreamed big and generally settled for much less.</p> <p>Morrigan jumped up on her own mount. They needed to make haste, before their hunting friends returned in greater numbers looking for the return of their property, and for a hanging as their supper amusement. Perhaps the hunters would have the minstrel play a lively tune, while Morrigan and her fellow thieves danced at the end of a rope. Aye, it was most assuredly time to leave.</p> <p>"Here, my friend," said Archie leading the minstrel toward Morrigan. "Allow us to give ye a ride."</p> <p>"Nay," said Morrigan, easily seeing Archie's intent. "Let him ride wi' someone else."</p> <p>"But ye are the lightest among us."</p> <p>"Nay, Toby over there is hardly seven stone."</p> <p>Archie walked quickly toward her and hissed, "Toby is a young fool. Ye take the minstrel and dinna let him get away." Archie turned back to the minstrel saying, "So pleased ye could join us."</p> <p>The minstrel smiled at Morrigan. "I am causing you inconvenience? I must apologize." His voice was smooth as velvet with his polished French accent. His eyes were a shocking, bright blue in contrast to his black hair, and even Morrigan had to admit that he was nice to look upon.</p> <p>"No inconvenience, I assure ye," Morrigan found herself saying. Maybe inviting a minstrel back with them was not such a bad idea.</p> <p>She reached out her hand to help him onto the horse and he took it, swinging himself up easily with little assistance. He positioned himself behind her, the thighs of his long legs touching hers. Suddenly Morrigan felt quite hot in her hauberk and she took a deep breath. Damn, but he smelled nice too.</p> <p>Morrigan revised her opinion of the minstrel. He was trouble; and like most of Archie's plans, it would no doubt go horribly wrong.</p></p><h2>Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican books : Philosophy)</h2><p>This title presents an insight into moral skepticism of the 20th century. The author argues that our every-day moral codes are an &#39;error theory&#39; based on the presumption of moral facts which, he persuasively argues, don&#39;t exist. His refutation of such facts is based on their metaphysical &#39;queerness&#39; and the observation of cultural relativity.</p><p>John Leslie Mackie (1917-1981) was a philosopher who made significant contributions to the fields of ethics, metaphysics, and the philosophy of religion.

Think of this small nation and your mind is likely to jump to Nazis, dictators, and soccer. Now, John Gimlette&#x2019;s eye-opening book&#x2013;equal parts travelogue, history, and unorthodox travel guide&#x2013;breaches the boundaries of this isolated land,&#x201d; and illuminates a little-understood place and its people.<br><br>It is a wonderfully animated telling of Paraguay's story: of cannibals, Jesuits, and sixteenth-century Anabaptists; of Victorian Australian socialists and talented smugglers; of dictators and their mad mistresses; bloody wars and Utopian settlements; and of lives transplanted from Japan, Britain, Poland, Russia, Germany, Ireland, Korea, and the United States. The author travels from the insular cities and towns of the east, along ghostly trails through the countryside, to reach the Gran Chaco of the west: the &#x201c;green hell&#x201d; covering almost two-thirds of the country, where 4 percent of the population coexists&#x2013;more or very-much-less peacefully&#x2013;with a vast array of exotic wildlife that includes jaguars, prehistoric lungfish, and their more recently evolved distant cousins, the great fighting river fish. Gimlette visits with Mennonites and the<i> indigenas,</i> arms dealers and real-estate tycoons, shopkeepers, government bureaucrats and, of course, Nazis. <br><br>Filled with bizarre incident, fascinating anecdote, and richly evocative detail, <i>At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig</i> is a brilliant description of a country of eccentricity and contradiction, of beguilingly individualistic men and women, and of unexpected and extraordinary beauty. It is a vivid, often riotous, always fascinating, journey.</p><p>John Gimlette is a practicing attorney in London, where he lives with his wife. He is a regular contributor of travel articles and photographs to <i>Cond� Nast Traveller,</i> as well as other journals and newspapers in England. This is his first book.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>My hostess was studying me with renewed interest.<br><br>"Did you say," she said slowly, "that he cut the child's hands off with a blowtorch?"<br><br>"Well, yes." I fidgeted. "Doesn't anyone remember?"<br><br>Down the table everyone shook their head, except the thief.<br><br>"I remember it," he said.<br><br>Attention swivelled in his direction. The thief was pouring more wine into his Coca-Cola. It was rumoured he'd skinned his own bank and almost got away with it. Overnight, they said, his eyes had turned black like a panda's, and his Dalmatians had run away.<br><br>"Didn't they make a film," he piped, "about The Blowtorch Case? With Antoni Opkins and those moths. That was here, wasn't it, M�nica? That was Paraguay?"<br><br>There was dissension from the silverware and glass.<br><br>The hostess was examining me again. "When did you hear these things, John?"<br><br>"When I first came here. About twenty years ago."<br><br>Ah, they all said, twenty years ago. Things were different then.<br><br>2<br><br>Throughout the summer of 1982, Asunci�n had been gripped by a good murder.<br><br>The body of the boy, fourteen years old and horribly mutilated by the blowtorch, had been discovered in a wealthy suburb. The details of the story were happily never very clear and the press had shown a maddening indifference to the whole affair, doubtless on the General's instructions. Perhaps his German priggishness had got the better of him or, more likely, he didn't want his Paraguayans to speculate on the possibility that his police did not have eyes and ears in every home. Starved of details by their caudillo, the citizens drank up the trickle of gossip that collected downtown, and suffocated by heat, they made themselves giddy with fantastical tales, each more grotesque than the last.<br><br>"They say he's someone in the government-a sadist," I was told by a friend, Reynaldo Gosling. Reynaldo was a few years older than me and was already a student, but he seemed to enjoy our meetings at the William Shakespeare, feasting on my most mawkish tales from England. One grandfather, he explained, had been a British railway engineer and the other had distinguished himself in the Chaco War of the thirties. Although he'd never been outside Paraguay he affected a familiarity with England and nurtured a fondness for El Pub Ingl�s. "Apparently, he tortured the boy for hours with a blowtorch before strangling him."<br><br>"Yes," agreed his pretty Guaran� girlfriend. "And he smashed the boy's face in too. They must have been lovers."<br><br>"That's shit," said another man, who'd been munching cornmeal chipa at the bar. "He's a Nazi. One of the General's Germans. I heard he did medical experiments in those Jewish camps. Someone's covering for him."<br><br>This was dangerous talk and Reynaldo steered us back towards safer ground and the more conventional wisdom. "Look, he's probably just some homosexual."<br><br>The police were at their wits' end, and truckloads of constables, old Mauser rifles wedged between their knees, ploughed up and down Independencia. They didn't expect to find the blowtorch killer but they could at least stifle the rumours of their own ineptitude. In a further act of desperation, they took a sniff at the gossip and rounded up all of Asunci�n's homosexuals. Not knowing what to do with such a large number of patently harmless individuals, they locked them up for a few days and then released them. The citizens were unappeased.<br><br>But it wasn't immediately obvious how the rumours thrived or even spread about the city. By day the centre of town was silent and deserted. Baked by the sun, the cobbles shimmered in a heat haze. The windows of the Guaran�-baroque mansions were tightly shuttered against the fierce white light, their vast panelled doors secured shut with bolts the size of ox-bones. Those who had the money had fled the heat by passing the summer on the beaches of Uruguay. A snake of BMWs slithered in and out every season.<br><br>It seemed that at these times of day only the beggars stirred in the centre of the city, and they didn't gather to gossip. "Most of them are survivors of the Chaco War," Reynaldo told me. "They got shot up in our war with Bolivia. Then they got amputations and now they hang around on the Plaza de Los H�roes. Actually, they're a nuisance."<br><br>They probably wouldn't be for much longer. With limbs so smashed by explosions and minds so raked by gunfire and whisky-tipo, it wouldn't be long now before old age mercifully carried them off-if the giant Mercedes buses that crashed over the ruts didn't get them first. Each time I passed them, I wondered if they ever thought of themselves as the lucky ones, the ones that survived a war so terrible that nearly a third of Paraguay's fighters perished.<br><br>There was a brief moment at the end of each day, that exquisite moment of dusk that tropical countries earn themselves, when the sun plunged into the R�o Paraguay and the city was suffused with pink light, when the citizens, those that remained, would emerge from their shuttered houses, blinking and shaking sleep out of their clothes. Some would stare blankly into the shop windows at the electrical goods smuggled in from Panama and the bottles of whisky piled up like ammunition. Others took their seats under the lapacho trees, in the Plaza Uruguaya, kicked off their shoes and waited for the officious, unofficial curfew to begin. Perhaps they gossiped, exchanging the latest gothic details on the blowtorch murder, but most just sat, waiting silently for the end of the day.<br><br>As the light changed from pink to purple, Asunci�n's only neon sign, large bright red letters on the pediment of the National Bank, flickered into life: PEACE, WORK AND WELL-BEING WITH STROESSNER. When they saw this, people put their shoes and socks back on and went home.<br><br>For some reason the writ of the curfew never extended to The Lido bar. As long as you could get yourself there and back, weaving around the patrols, it seemed as though you could sit there as long as you liked, sluicing away the dust and diesel with icy pilsen called Antarctica. It ought to have been the perfect place for the traffic in good stories. It stood right at the centre of town and had even been described rather whimsically as lying "at the crossroads of South America." Inside, a great amphitheatre of tangerine-coloured bar swooped out into a brilliant white room. It was a room full of air that swirled in through the windows, was whipped by giant ceiling fans and then hustled out on to the street again. It was pure 1950s; you pulled upholstered stools up to the bar and gave your orders to the little duck-hipped ladies in tangerine aprons and tangerine hats who waddled around in the arena.<br><br>Paraguayans enjoyed it, but their enjoyment was reverential and mute. They sat huddled around the counter, inward-looking, facing each other across the gorgeous orange arena; there were the middle-class Hispanics with their brilliantined hair, pig-skin briefcases and buckled alligator shoes; there were mestizos and touts, Mak� Indians selling bows and arrows and mercantes hawking lace as thin and light as cobwebs; there were ruddy, blond immigrants from Latvia, Ukraine and the Balkans spooning up bori-bori soup with big, farmers' hands; there were the German settlers pawing over Neues f�r Alle, while their wives, hair-dyed and lacquer-faced, sipped terer�, an icy privet-leaf tea; then there were Koreans, newcomers to the scene, who'd set themselves up around the mercado and who only occasionally came down to town for acupuncture or lumbago treatment and who stuck to the cold beer. They all ate and sipped and spooned and sucked in silence, while the orange ladies heaved great trays of parillada steak and juicy hummocks of steaming maize cake out of the kitchens. The diners stared through them, at each other, wondering, I fancied, who was the police informer, who was the whisky smuggler, who was the Nazi and who could do that to a boy so young.<br><br>When the silence of the Paraguayans became too much, I would duck across the Plaza and up Calle Chile to the Shakespeare. Although it called itself a pub, it was really just a room above a Korean pharmacy, reached by some musty stairs. It wasn't even particularly English, although it was staffed by two Glaswegians who thought that life in such a place was "better than life on the dole." The young Paraguayans thought it was Paradise, even though there was nothing to drink but Antarctica and the temperature seldom fell below gas mark 3. They liked to hear Rod Stewart roaring out of the tape recorder and they were thrilled to be in a place that could rumble with laughter. Above all they loved the way that you had to shout very loud-in English-to be heard. It allowed them to transport themselves in their imaginations away from the stifling conformity and oppression of Asunci�n to England, a place hardly any of them had seen, where people had endless fun and sex and danced all night around their palm trees. The illusion was sustained for as long as it took before someone tripped over the plug to the tape deck, throttled Rod Stewart and plunged us all back into silence. During the lull, I was spotted by a girl with a fantastic rick of black hair piled up around her head.<br><br>"Are you English, kid?"<br><br>"Yes," I admitted. I was terrified; girls at my school hadn't behaved like this. She was sucking the icebergs out of her Antarctica and crunching them up with her teeth. "Are you?"<br><br>"Course I'm fucking not. This is Paraguay. I'm fucking Paraguayan." She took a step back and cocked her head, awaiting my reaction. I failed to say anything.<br><br>"OK. Look. My father was Japanese and my mother half-Spanish and half fucking English. That makes me fucking Paraguayan."<br><br>"You speak good English,...</p><h2>The Oxford Book of Money</h2><p>Money. Rhino. The long green. It is "the most important thing in the world" (George Bernard Shaw). It is "the alienated essence of man's work and existence" (Karl Marx). It is a medium of exchange, a measure of value, a standard of deferred payment. It is "better than poverty, if only for financial reasons" (Woody Allen).<br> Few things occupy as central a place in our lives as money, and few provoke such intense and varied response. Now in an entertaining and thought-provoking book, Kevin Jackson brings together reflections on money by some of the most brilliant minds who ever lived, drawing on such writers as Dante and Chaucer, Dostoevsky and Dickens, Mark Twain and Jane Austen, and such thinkers as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and John Maynard Keynes. Here is an all-encompassing look at the bottom line of human life--wealth and poverty, lending and borrowing, money heavens and money hells. By looking at money from many different perspectives, whether through colorful scenes from fiction or telling portraits of eras past, <em>The Oxford Book of Money</em> offers us a deeper appreciation of what money is, what it can do, what it is really worth. By turns insightful, amusing, and intriguing, it will help readers to reexamine what money means to them and rethink its value in their lives. <br></p><p>Few things occupy as central a place in our lives as money, and few provoke such intense and varied response.

It contains detailed studies of the way in which Israelite man was thought of, and of the ways in which the Old Testament describes his physical being. Part two then goes on to look at the context in which Hebrew man lived out his existence, and its notion of time and of the created universe, in which man both worked and found leisure. Part three moves on to the social aspect of man&#39;s life, with its institutions, pattems of relationship and moral demands. A concluding chapter sums up the overall picture given in the Old Testament of man&#39;s destiny. The book is well translated and readable, and has a very great usefulness for the general reader of the Bible, because of the way in which it fills out the picture of what life was like in Old Testament times. While it is primarily aimed at a theological readership, ft will prove to be an indispensable tool for any study of Old Testament ethics. At a host of points it describes very lucidly the context of moral behaviour in the life of ancient Israel. In line with this it reveals very clearly the possibilities which life offered, and serves in a number of ways to illuminate the reasoning behind Israelite laws. All in all it impresses the reader with a recognition of the inextricable way in which culture, religion and morality are intertwined in the Old Testament. Only by attention to this can biblical morality and the biblical conception of man be understood.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>We Need to Talk About Kevin</h2><p>Two years ago, Eva Khatchadourian&#39;s son, Kevin, murdered seven of his fellow high-school students, a cafeteria worker, and a popular algebra teacher. Because he was only fifteen at the time of the killings, he received a lenient sentence and is now in a prison for young offenders in upstate New York. Telling the story of Kevin&#39;s upbringing, Eva addresses herself to her estranged husband through a series of letters. Fearing that her own shortcomings may have shaped what her son has become, she confesses to a deep, long-standing ambivalence about both motherhood in general and Kevin in particular. How much is her fault? Lionel Shriver tells a compelling, absorbing, and resonant story while framing these horrifying tableaux of teenage carnage as metaphors for the larger tragedy - the tragedy of a country where everything works, nobody starves, and anything can be bought but a sense of purpose.</p><p><p>Eva never really wanted to be a mother&#x2014;and certainly not the mother of a boy who ends up murdering seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker, and a much-adored teacher who tried to befriend him, all two days before his sixteenth birthday. Now, two years later, it is time for her to come to terms with marriage, career, family, parenthood, and Kevin&#x2019;s horrific rampage, in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her estranged husband, Franklin. Uneasy with the sacrifices and social demotion of motherhood from the start, Eva fears that her alarming dislike for her own son may be responsible for driving him so nihilistically off the rails.</p>Lionel Shriver&#39;s seventh novel, We Need to Talk About Kevin, won the 2005 Orange Prize. Her other novels are: A Perfectly Good Family, Game Control, Ordinary Decent Criminals, Checker and the Derailleurs and The Female of the Species.

Aramaic was the language of Jesus and his countrymen of Israel, as well as that of neighboring Syria, Persia, Asia, and all Jewish colonies throughout the known world. The Peshitta has a long tradition among Syrian and Assyrian (Iraqi and Lebanese) Christians as being the original text of the New Testament written by the Apostles and Evangelists of Jesus in the first century AD. Mel Gibson&#39;s film, The Passion of The Christ presented an Aramaic script for most of the dialogue of Jesus and the Apostles and other Jews, which added realism, historic accuracy and power to the film.

She lives in New York City with her husband and children.Once, when she was thirteen, Carmen remembered turning to Tibby with her CosmoGirl magazine in one hand and her eye pencil in the other and declaring that she could never, ever get sick of doing makeovers.<br><br>Well, it turned out she could. Sitting in the makeup chair in early October in a trailer parked on the corner of Bleecker Street and the Bowery in the East Village of Manhattan, getting her hair blown out for the seven millionth time by a girl named Rita and the foundation sponged onto her face for the eight millionth time by a girl named Genevieve, Carmen knew it was just another mile on the hedonic treadmill. You could get sick of anything.<br><br>It was true. She&#x2019;d read an article in Time magazine about it. &#x201c;You could even get sick of chocolate,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told her mother on the phone the night before.<br><br>Her mother had made a doubting sound.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I read, anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>Being an actress on a TV show, even a moderately good and successful TV show, involved a few minutes of acting for every few hours you spent in the makeup chair. And even when you were done with the makeup&#x2014;temporarily, of course; you were never done with the makeup&#x2014;there was still a whole lot of sitting around drinking lattes. That was the dirty secret of the entertainment industry: it was boring.<br><br>Granted, Carmen didn&#x2019;t have the biggest part in the show. She was Special Investigator Lara Brennan on Criminal Court. She showed up at least briefly at a crime scene in almost every episode and sometimes got to appear as a witness on the stand.<br><br>&#x201c;Eyes up,&#x201d; Genevieve said, coming in with a mascara wand. It was rare that Carmen needed a prompt. She knew exactly which way to turn her eyes for each portion of the mascara application. If she didn&#x2019;t stay ahead of it, Carmen feared she&#x2019;d end up like one of the many dolls she&#x2019;d mangled as a child with her constant brutal efforts at grooming.<br><br>Carmen studied her hair in the mirror. She&#x2019;d never thought she&#x2019;d get sick of that either. She squinted down the highlights. They were a little brassy, a little bright this time. She would have liked to go darker, but the director wanted her light. Probably because her character&#x2019;s surname was Brennan and not Garcia.<br><br>Carmen jiggled her phone in her hand and thought of who to call. She&#x2019;d already spoken to Lena once and her agent twice. Her mind summoned a glimpse of Tibby&#x2019;s face, more out of loyalty than an expectation of actually talking to her. Since Tibby had moved to Australia with Brian almost two years before, Carmen had almost given up hope of reaching her in real time. Tibby&#x2019;s move had been hasty, somewhat disorganized, and just . . . far. The sixteen-hour time difference was a constant impediment. Tibby had gone from place to place at first and didn&#x2019;t get a landline until long after Carmen had given up on the idea. International calls between their cellphones were plagued by stupid complications, mostly on Tibby&#x2019;s side. In a couple of weeks. In a month. By next spring. Those were the times when Carmen told herself they&#x2019;d resume regular contact. Carmen often thought of hauling over there for a visit. This past June she&#x2019;d staked out a date on the calendar, and Bee and Lena had instantly agreed to the scheme. When she&#x2019;d emailed Tibby about it, Tibby&#x2019;s return had come more quickly than usual. &#x201c;Now&#x2019;s not a good time.&#x201d;<br><br>Carmen took it personally for once. &#x201c;Did I do something?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked in her next message.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Carma, no. You did nothing wrong. Nothing. Just busy and unsettled here. It&#x2019;ll be soon. I promise. I want to see you and Len and Bee more than anything else in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>And there was Bee. Carmen hadn&#x2019;t seen her since Bridget&#x2019;s last swing through New York over the Christmas holidays, but there were long periods when Bridget and Carmen talked every day&#x2014;that is, as long as Bee hadn&#x2019;t lost her phone or neglected to pay her bill for too long. Bee was the best possible distraction from an hour in the makeup chair. But Carmen hesitated to call her now. It had been awkward between them for the last few weeks, since Bee had effectively called Jones an asshole.<br><br>Well, to be fair, Bee hadn&#x2019;t just come out and said &#x201c;Your fianc� is an asshole.&#x201d; In fact, to be fair, it was Carmen who&#x2019;d called him an asshole and Bee who&#x2019;d lost no time in agreeing with her. But Carmen was allowed to say Jones was an asshole. She was the one marrying the asshole.<br><br>Carmen&#x2019;s phone rang, saving her the trouble of dialing anyone, and she snapped it up. The earphones were already stuck in her ears. She was one of the few people she knew who answered the phone as she checked the caller ID, not after.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, babe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Jones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the chair still?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; Jones was in the business, so he knew how it went. Besides, he&#x2019;d called her half an hour before.<br><br>&#x201c;How late are you shooting tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Till around seven, Steven said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you can, cut out a little early and come directly to the Mandarin, all right? It&#x2019;s the pre-party before the big Haiti benefit. It&#x2019;s important for you to at least show.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t make a difference to Haiti if I don&#x2019;t get there in time for the pre-party.&#x201d; It was one of three benefits they had on the calendar that week.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about Haiti,&#x201d; Jones said, as though she were being dense. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about the Shaws. They invited us, and I don&#x2019;t want to stiff them. She&#x2019;s probably going to be head of production by next year. We&#x2019;ll be out of there by eight. Nobody&#x2019;s going to stay for the whole thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Of course.&#x201d; Cynical though she was, Carmen never remembered to be quite cynical enough. Why would she think the Haiti benefit was about Haiti and not about the Shaws? Why would she think the gala was about the gala and not about the party before the gala? If not for Jones, she could have been one of the boobs who thought it was about Haiti and stayed for the whole thing.<br><br>It was endlessly tricky being in the know. It was a state Carmen had achieved with a certain bravado, but she found it difficult to maintain. Without Jones, she could easily slip out of the know, relapse into her natural eagerness, and probably never get hired for another part in her life.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a game and you play it,&#x201d; he often told her when she felt discouraged or repulsed. &#x201c;If you want to succeed in this business, it&#x2019;s what you do. Otherwise, you gotta pick a different business.&#x201d; He was thirty-nine years old to her twenty-nine. He&#x2019;d been doing it for sixteen years, he always reminded her. But he didn&#x2019;t need to tell her. Whether or not she liked it, she was perfectly good at playing the game when she chose to.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to be there before seven,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Carmen felt vaguely dissatisfied as she ended the call. It wasn&#x2019;t that Jones didn&#x2019;t care about charities. He did. Every month he put five percent of his earnings into a charitable fund. You couldn&#x2019;t fault him for that.<br><br>&#x201c;Was that your boyfriend again?&#x201d; Rita asked.<br><br>Carmen nodded distractedly. Sometimes it was hard to know what you could fault him for.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s an executive at ABC, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded again. Everybody in this business was looking for another contact.<br><br>&#x201c;Lucky you,&#x201d; Rita said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. And not just because he was her boyfriend, but because he was her fianc�. If she was lucky, then she was extra lucky.<br><br>And what if she wasn&#x2019;t lucky? Then what was she?<br>Lena put her feet up on her desk. The pink polish her sister, Effie, had applied to her toenails during her last visit had long since started to chip. Lena balanced a sketchbook on her knees and began to flip through it.<br><br>She&#x2019;d promised herself she&#x2019;d clear out her apartment today. She was committed to filling a couple of trash bags with stuff&#x2014;her place was too tiny to store anything extra&#x2014;but of her twenty-seven sketchbooks, she hadn&#x2019;t yet been able to throw away even one. This one, for instance, was an old one. On the first page was a pencil sketch of Mimi, Tibby&#x2019;s old guinea pig, fat and asleep in her shavings. As long ago as it was, Lena vividly remembered the joyful chaos of pencil lines that had gone into sketching those shavings. There was a drawing of Bridget at sixteen, knees up on the couch, watching TV with a tipping sombrero on her head. It must have been a week or two after she&#x2019;d gotten back from her soccer camp in Mexico. It was a loose pencil sketch, and Lena smiled at the hatching lines she&#x2019;d used to represent the suntan on Bee&#x2019;s cheeks. Every few pages was one of the inescapable drawings of Lena&#x2019;s feet. There was a half-finished sketch of grumpy morning Effie at fifteen, too grumpy to let Lena finish it. There were three studies of Carmen&#x2019;s hand from when she still wore a mood ring and bit her fingernails. How could you throw this away?<br><br>The later sketchbooks would be easier, Lena decided. They were mostly just feet and dated from about two years earlier, when Lena had mostly petered out on drawing. Instead, these last couple of years she had been putting her energies into her paintings, which were composed, formal, and largely abstract. You weren&#x2019;t going to build a career out of making messy little sketches of your friends and family and your feet.<br><br>Why all the drawings of her feet? They were not her best feature, probably her worst. They were size nine and a half, ten in some shoes, and prone to sweating when she was excited or nervous. Her toes were kind...</p><h2>500 Cameras: 170 Years of Photographic Innovation</h2><p>From the world-famous Eastman House comes a lavish, expansive guide to nearly 200 years of photographic invention and innovation.

Galiano and Fred Lieblich, when the telephone finally rang.</p><p>Speyer, a thirty- seven-year-old with a marathoner&#x2019;s lanky build; sandy, close-cropped hair; and a machine-gun laugh, was the heir apparent to Tishman Speyer Properties, an international real estate company that operated on four continents and controlled some of New York City&#x2019;s most enduring icons, from Rockefeller Center to the Chrysler Building. For ten weeks, he and his colleagues had labored over a bid for a property whose size was almost unimaginable in densely packed Manhattan: Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, a complex of 110 buildings with 11,232 apartments spread across 80 contiguous acres south of midtown, overlooking the East River.</p><p>Galiano, at forty-one years old, was Tishman Speyer&#x2019;s intensely focused co-chief of acquisitions. Lieblich was president of BlackRock Realty Advisors, forty-five years old and a partner in the prospective deal. They had formed a friendship with Speyer as they read the financial history of the rental complex and engineering assessments supplied by the seller, Metropolitan Life Insurance, or as it is known today, MetLife. By noon that day, they submitted their offer. They were up against an international who&#x2019;s who of real estate and finance that had gathered in New York for what promised to be the biggest real estate deal in history. Aside from New York&#x2019;s real estate royalty, like the Durst, Rudin and LeFrak families, there was the emir of Qatar; the Rothschilds and the Safras; the mysterious billionaire investor Simon Glick; the irascible Steve Roth of Vornado Realty Trust; Stephen Ross, a builder active in New York, Florida, Las Vegas and Los Angeles; the government of Singapore; and the Church of England, not to mention the many pension funds and private equity firms that had raised tens of billions of dollars to invest in real estate and other assets. Nearly a dozen rival bidders from around the globe were gathered in similar rooms high above Manhattan waiting to learn whether their multibillion-dollar offers had won the day and if they would spend the night negotiating contractual details of what would be the largest transaction in American real estate history.</p><p>The stark white walls of the Tishman Speyer conference room yielded nothing as the hours ticked by. One minute Speyer exuded the cocky confidence of a tycoon who prowled the world making deals, the next he wondered what might have gone wrong as a dark cloud of self-doubt descended over the conversation.</p><p>They had spent the afternoon of October 16, 2006, talking about anything but the call they desperately hoped would come. Adrian Fenty, who was running for mayor in Washington, DC, where the Speyers owned more than two dozen office buildings, popped into the room for a minute to say hello. He asked what was going on. Speyer explained it was &#x201c;a fairly momentous day&#x201d;; they were waiting to see who had won the bidding war. &#x201c;I just came from Apollo&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; Fenty said with a chuckle, referring to Apollo Real Estate Advisors, Speyer&#x2019;s primary rival for the property. &#x201c;They told me the same thing.&#x201d;</p><p>Then with the evening shadows gathering over Fifth Avenue, the phone rang a second and third time. Speyer snatched up the receiver and heard the voice of Darcy A. Stacom, the real estate broker conducting the multibillion-dollar auction of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village.</p><p>Stacom, who was forty-six years old and a rare woman in the testosterone-fueled world of high- stakes real estate deals, quickly got to the point: &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon down to Two Hundred Park, now.&#x201d; But she warned, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bring your whole team together. Come in ones and twos in case any reporters have staked out the lobby of the building.&#x201d; Two Hundred Park housed MetLife&#x2019;s law firm, Greenberg Traurig, and at the top, MetLife&#x2019;s ornate, old-world boardroom.</p><p>Stacom had not offered him congratulations, but Speyer knew what the call meant: If they could get through what promised to be hours of arguing over the final terms of the contract, Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper was his. He let out a yell as he put the phone down, almost simultaneously pumping his fist and hugging Galiano. Speyer turned and embraced Lieblich, who headed the real estate arm for one of the world&#x2019;s largest investment management firms for pension funds, institutions and high- net- wealth individuals.</p><p>Speyer and Galiano took the elevator to the ground floor and marched out the Fifth Avenue doors of the building, past the fifteen-foot bronze statue of a heavily muscled Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders. Speyer was under his own mythic strain and would remember little of the eight-block walk downtown.</p><p>Although not nearly as glamorous as Rockefeller Center, Stuyvesant Town held a pride of place in the minds of many New Yorkers. Stuyvesant Town, and its sister complex Peter Cooper Village, was unlike the real estate properties that seemed to trade like pork bellies on a daily basis in cities from Atlanta to Los Angeles, Boston to Dallas and Seattle during what was now a five-year-old real estate boom like no other in its intensity. Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village covered eighteen blocks of some of the most valuable real estate in the world.</p><p>The two complexes, which were erected by Metropolitan Life in what was once known as the Gas House District, were an urban version of Levittown, an inspiration for housing in the 1950s and 1960s that broke up the street grid rather than conformed to it, while keeping city life affordable to the middle class.</p><p>In the 1960s, Stuyvesant Town begat LeFrak City, a complex of ten eighteen-story buildings on forty acres in Corona, Queens, and Co-op City, a sprawling complex of 15,372 units in 35 high- rise towers and seven clusters of town houses spread across 320 acres in the Baychester section of the Bronx. Architecturally it was a failure. The red brick buildings were uniformly plain and looked more like the low-income housing projects nearby, the Jacob Riis, Lillian Wald and Alfred E. Smith Houses. But the buildings occupied neatly landscaped real estate on the East Side. In 2006, there were not eighty, or even twenty, contiguous acres available anywhere else on the thirteen-mile-long island of Manhattan, no matter what the price.</p><p>And Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, despite its blandness, had been a safe, leafy oasis for thousands of middle-class firefighters, nurses, union construction workers, civil servants, writers, police officers, secretaries and even a few judges for nearly sixty years. For many New Yorkers, the complex had become a cherished landmark akin to the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty and Rockefeller Center. Early in their careers, Mayor John V. Lindsay, sportscaster Howard Cosell, reporter Gabe Pressman and presidential adviser David Axelrod had made their homes there. So had author Frank McCourt, mystery writer Mary Higgins Clark, actor Paul Reiser, operatic soprano Beverly Sills and Knicks basketball star Dick Barnett.</p><p>In 2006, hundreds of original tenants, many of whom had moved to Stuyvesant Town when it opened in 1947, were still living there. Thousands more had grown up in those twelve-and thirteen- story buildings and were now raising their own families in Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of the most unique assets in the city,&#x201d; said Lieblich, who had himself lived in Stuyvesant Town when he was a MetLife executive in the 1990s. &#x201c;A lot of people know of it. There&#x2019;s a lot of fond memories.&#x201d;</p><p>As Rob Speyer entered 200 Park Avenue, a fifty-eight-story skyscraper looming over Grand Central Terminal that had once been known as the Pan Am Building, he paused, noticing a handmade sign Scotch-taped to a storefront window promoting a sale. Tishman Speyer had bought the tower from MetLife eighteen months earlier for $1.72 billion, the highest price ever paid for an office building. The makeshift placard was just the kind of seedy thing that he had been trying to eliminate since taking control of the property. Shake it off, Rob said to himself, focus on the task at hand. He was up against eight other buyers who, in preparation for a bidding war, had collectively lined up a staggering $50 billion from money center banks, insurance companies, pension funds and private investors.</p><p>Every day seemed to bring another record real estate deal somewhere in the country and the prospect of windfall profits. The December 2004 sale of the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago for $835 million had set a local record, despite the building&#x2019;s sizable vacancy. Maguire Properties, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, paid $1.5 billion for 10 office buildings in the Los Angeles area, thereby doubling the size of its portfolio and solidifying its position as the top landlord for first-class office space in Southern California. In the biggest retail deal of 2005, a joint venture of Regency Centers Corporation and Macquarie CountryWide Trust paid $2.7 billion for 101 shopping centers in 17 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Buyers jostled in line for bulk purchases of hotels, shopping malls, casinos, office buildings, apartment complexes and raw land. Prices accelerated far faster than rents, even as profit margins got thinner. Expectations were that prices would climb still higher. It was as if the markets had broken loose from their tether to the boom-and-bust nature of capitalism. At least that is the way the lenders acted, as well as the rating agencies whose job it was to judge the viability of the financial architecture underpinning the deals. And nowhere was the real estate market as hot as it was in New York.</p><p>That summer, Beacon Capital Partners, in partnership with Lehman Brothers, outbid thirty rivals when it paid $1.52 billion for 1211 Avenue of the Americas, a thirty-three-year-old, forty-four-story office tower whose prime tenant was News Corporation, the mass media conglomerate headed by Rupert Murdoch. At $800 per square foot, analysts expected Beacon to lose money, at least in the short term, because the mortgage payments were likely to exceed cash flow from the building. But Beacon, like many investors, was supremely optimistic about the future and it was determined not to lose out again. Previously, Beacon had been an also- ran in the bidding for twenty-three-story 522 Fifth Avenue, at Forty-Third Street, a prize captured by Broadway Partners with a bid of $420 million.</p><p>Speyer and Galiano settled into a small fifteenth-floor conference room off the main reception area at Greenberg Traurig, soon to be joined by Tishman Speyer&#x2019;s lawyer, Jonathan L. Mechanic, and two associates. Stacom, whose blond hair floated halfway down her back and who had a fondness for dangling costume jewelry and Technicolor clothing, was already present with her partner William M. Shanahan, the numbers specialist for the duo. In a conference room down the hall sat Robert R. Merck, a senior managing director and chief of MetLife&#x2019;s real estate investment unit; David V. Politano, who oversaw MetLife&#x2019;s real estate investments in the Northeast; and their coterie of lawyers. The insurer was selling the sister complexes as a single real estate asset.</p><p>Much of the contract had been marked up and completed in the course of the bidding, but now the lawyers would take over, hammering out language that would cover every possible contingency. The shuttling between the two rooms went on through the night, as lawyers for Tishman Speyer and MetLife inserted clauses to protect their clients against any possible trouble.</p><p>In between, Speyer, Lieblich, Galiano and other executives in the conference room debated the latest revisions. During the prolonged interludes, they played poker, five-card draw. One of the young associates from Mechanic&#x2019;s law firm cleaned up, even as the others teased him about how his skinny black suit and tie made him look like a member of the late-1970s New Wave group Devo.</p><p>Finally, at about nine thirty in the morning on October 17, they finished. Speyer had a $400 million nonrefundable deposit wired to MetLife for the biggest real estate deal of all time. He and his partners agreed to pay an astounding $5.4 billion&#x2014;$70 million more than the number two bidder&#x2014;for a single asset.</p><p>But that was not the total price tag. When all the acquisition costs were tallied, the sum would total $6.3 billion. Ultimately, the money would come from banks, foreign and domestic pension funds, a foreign government and the Church of England. A tiny fraction of the money would come out of the well-lined pockets of Tishman Speyer or BlackRock. Both firms traditionally bought property with what is known in the business as OPM (other people&#x2019;s money). They largely made their money on fees&#x2014;asset fees, management fees, partnership fees, construction fees&#x2014;while putting up only a sliver of equity, if that. Of course, no pension fund or wealthy family would invest with Tishman Speyer or BlackRock simply for the privilege of paying fees if the firms did not consistently generate annual returns on the order of 20 percent. Of the total cost of $6.3 billion, Tishman Speyer put up only $56 million of the firm&#x2019;s own money, less than 1 percent of the winning bid, with another $56 million coming from their longtime partner, the Crown family of Chicago.</p><p>The deal immediately created a media storm of headlines around the world, generating editorial comment from the Agence France-Presse, the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>, National Public Radio and Bill Maher at HBO.</p><p>The <i>New York Post</i> put it succinctly: &#x201c;$5.4 Bil Stuy Town Deal Shatters Record.&#x201d; Rob told the tabloid that &#x201c;the opportunity to buy 11,000 units in Manhattan is what you live for.&#x201d;</p><p>Elated but tired, Rob called his father, the real estate magnate Jerry I. Speyer, to deliver the news in a voice scratchy with fatigue. The elder Speyer congratulated him, heaping praise on a son who had forsaken a career in journalism to join his empire a decade earlier. Now his son was debuting on a very public stage.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a dream come true,&#x201d; confided the elder Speyer, whose powerful reach extended from his company to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Museum of Modern Art and the New York Yankees. He helped Michael R. Bloomberg successfully clear the legal and political hurdles to run for a third term as mayor in 2009 and both he and his son were close to Andrew Cuomo, who would become governor in 2010. &#x201c;I expect he&#x2019;ll be far more successful than I was,&#x201d; Jerry Speyer said of his son. &#x201c;He has great vision, wonderful people skills, and above all, he loves what he does.&#x201d;</p><p>The two men quickly divided up a list of courtesy calls, with Jerry taking Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Rob reaching out to Daniel R. Garodnick, a lifelong resident of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village and a newly elected city councilman. Rob assured Garodnick, &#x201c;There will be no dramatic shifts in the community&#x2019;s makeup, character or charm.&#x201d;</p><p>But Garodnick did not greet the ...</p></p><h2>Basic Wilderness Survival Skills</h2><p>From building fires to building shelters, the best advice from expert survivalist Bradford Angier all in one handy guide.</p><p>For every outdoors person, there may come a time when you will need to know how to stay alive in the backcountry.

She takes a badly needed job working for ex-Master of the Universe Will Traynor, who is wheelchair bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge life--big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travel--and now he's pretty sure he cannot live the way he is. <br> Will is acerbic, moody, bossy--but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living. <br>"A Love Story" for this generation, "Me Before You" brings to life two people who couldn't have less in common--a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, "What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?"</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2013</strong><strong>:</strong> Before Louisa met Will, her plans didn't reach beyond their tiny English town. Will, when he wasn't closing multimillion-dollar deals, blew off steam scaling mountains, leaping from planes, and enjoying exquisite women--until an accident left him paralyzed and seriously depressed. When his mother hires Lou to keep his spirits up, he meets her awkward overtures with caustic contempt, but she's tenacious and oddly endearing. Their fondness grows into something deeper, gaining urgency when she realizes his determination to end his life, and her efforts to convince him of its value throw her own bland ambitions into question. Plumbing morally complex depths with comedy and compassion, Jojo Moyes elevates the story of Lou and Will from what could have been a maudlin weepie into a tragic love story, with a catharsis that will wring out your heart and leave you feeling fearless. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em>Jojo Moyes is the &#34;New York Times&#34; bestselling author of &#34;The Girl You Left Behind,&#34; &#34; Honeymoon in Paris,&#34; &#34;Me Before You,&#34; and &#34;The Last Letter from Your Lover.&#34; Moyes writes for a variety of newspapers and magazines.

This should not be seen as a guide to attempting to harvest these plants, but rather a short and educational guide merely on their existence. This guide includes completely legal plants (such as chamomile and valerian) alongside those of a more regulated quality (like Amanita Muscaria) and as well those that are illegal for consumption but remain in a strange legal gray area (like the opium poppy- which produces both heroin and poppy seeds for bagels.) From the herbal and mundane to the dangerously poisonous, and from the wild growing to the generally cultivated, this booklet attempts to quantify some of the more commonly encountered species.

A historian and journalist who was one of the earliest and staunchest Afrikaner opponents of apartheid, Hermann Giliomee weaves together life stories and historical interpretation to create a narrative history of the Afrikaners from their beginnings with the colonization of the Cape of Good Hope by the Dutch East India Company to the dismantling of apartheid and beyond. The Afrikaners emphasizes the crucial role played by historical actors without underplaying the impact of social forces over which they had little control. Throughout their history, Giliomee&#x2019;s Afrikaners are both colonizers and colonized. Actual or virtual servants of the Dutch East India Company, the Dutch "burghers" nonetheless owned slaves and commanded servant labor. The British conquests of 1795 and 1806 extended the rights of British subjects to Afrikaners, even as they took away the Afrikaners&#x2019; political autonomy and confirmed an economic and cultural subordination that was only partly alleviated by their dominance of South African politics in the latter part of the twentieth century. </p><p> </p><p>Demographically squeezed between far more numerous Africans (and other nonwhite groups) and their more affluent and culturally confident English compatriots, the Afrikaners forged a language-based national identity in which die-hard defense of privilege and opposition to various forms of British domination are inextricably intertwined with fears about cultural and even physical group survival. This nationalism underlay the Great Trek, in which Afrikaners opposed the abolition of slavery and legalized racial discrimination by the British; the irony of their becoming the twentieth century&#x2019;s first fighters against imperial domination in the Boer War; and the Afrikaners&#x2019; rise to political dominance over their English rivals and nonwhite South Africans alike, even as they remained economically and culturally subordinate to the former. This same language-based nationalism spawned the blunders and horrors of apartheid, but it also led the Afrikaners to relinquish power peacefully when this seemed the safest route to their survival as a people.</p><p>While documenting&#x2015;and in important ways revising&#x2015;the history of the Afrikaners&#x2019; pursuit of racial domination (as well as British contributions to that enterprise), Giliomee supplies Afrikaners&#x2019; own, often divided, perspectives on their history, perspectives not always or entirely skewed by their struggle for privilege at Africans&#x2019; expense. The result is not only a magisterial history of the Afrikaners but a fuller understanding of their history, which, for good or ill, resonates far beyond the borders of South Africa.</p></p><p><p>Hermann Giliomee, Professor of History at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa, is the editor or author of thirteen books, including Negotiating South Africa&#x2019;s Future, Awkward Embrace: One-Party Domination and Democracy in Industrialising Countries, From Apartheid to Nation-Building, and The Shaping of South African Society.

His skill at reworked scripts led him to bigger and bigger projects, even as the salary set by his long-term contract with Warner Brothers remained below that of most of his colleagues.

Many years later, as a retired film director with more than thirty movies to his credit, Vincent Sherman is no less surprised when he looks back on that life. In Studio Affairs he retraces his steps with candor and enthusiasm. Sherman relates the events of his days directly and honestly. He candidly discusses the details of his three-year relationship with Joan Crawford, his inadvertent connection with the death of Bette Davis&#39;s second husband, and his poignant romantic involvement with Rita Hayworth. Providing counterpoint to these liaisons is the love and devotion of Sherman&#39;s wife, Hedda, who accepted her husband&#39;s occasional infidelities as part and parcel of his career. The heart of Studio Affairs provides an inside look at the motion picture industry during the heyday of the studio system by one who worked his way from nearly starving actor and playwright to respected director. Drawing examples from his long career, Sherman discusses how he reworked flawed scripts, elicited strong performances from sometimes limited actors, placated his superiors and big-name talent, and won the support of his crews. Like so many talented individuals in Hollywood during the 1950s, Sherman was targeted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, owing in part to his active support of the WPA Theatre project in New York two decades previous. Time spent on the lesser-known gray list kept him out of work for several years. Eventually, he again enjoyed some critical success, but after the demise of the studio system life was never quite the same. This quintessential&#34;studio director&#34; ended his career directing for television.Hollywood reminiscences, and more, from the quintessential studio system director. When Sherman began his directing career in the 1930s, directors were almost as low on the Hollywood totem pole as writers, just one more component of a vast hierarchy where real power and creative vision tended to belong to executive producers and studio moguls. At the heart of the system was its audacious application of the mass production techniques of the Industrial Revolution to movies. Good or bad, films had to be cranked out on a regular schedule to help cover the studios' huge overheads. Jack Warner's appeal to Sherman was typical: ``I know it's not a great story, but I've got six actors sitting around doing nothing but picking up their checks . . . do me a favor: Make the picture and do the best you can.'' Much of Sherman's career consisted of doing precisely this, reluctantly taking on films he didn't like and then trying to improve them as much as tight schedules and budgets allowed. Over the course of 30 features, he sometimes succeeded-- Mr. Skeffington, The Hard Way--and sometimes failed. Along the way he worked with some of the greatest of the greats: Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Paul Newman. He also enjoyed a reputation as a ``woman's director,'' working with Joan Crawford, Rita Hayworth, and the notoriously difficult Bette Davis (he had extramarital affairs with all three). Despite his current semi-obscurity, his films are certainly worth a second look. Those seeking a portrait of Hollywood's seedy underbelly won't find it here. What Sherman has written is far more unusual: a frank, detailed, eminently clear record of the exhausting, exhilarating business of making films. The life, times, and techniques of a director from Hollywood's so-called ``Golden Age'' have rarely been so illuminatingly and insightfully detailed.

From lilting lines about a love that "dizzies up the brain's back room" to haunting fragments betokening death and decline in a suffering world, Kim Addonizio articulates the ways that our connectionsto the world, to self, and to othersendure and help make us whole.</p><p><b>Kim Addonizio</b> lives in Oakland, California.Unashamedly populist, and often charming, Addonizio's fourth book of verse explores the pleasures of sex, the pains of mourning, the efforts of raising a daughter and the difficulties of minor celebrity, setting all her musings and recollections in a style two parts confessional, one part stand-up comedy, and one part talking blues. Addonizio (Tell Me) makes reference both to famous bluesmen (Robert Johnson) and to their repetition-based forms. The first two parts of this five-part collection repeat single subjects as well: first the erotic life (a "31-year-old lover" "stands naked in my bedroom and nothing/ has harmed him yet"), and then the dead ("no real grief left/ for the man who was my father"). Exploring "the way of the world/ the sorrowful versus the happy," the rest of Addonizio's book takes up lighter, more varied subjects, often with a defter hand: "This Poem Wants to Be a Rock and Roll Song So Bad" self-mockingly "captures the essence of today's youth," while "This Poem Is in Recovery" promises "I'm not going to get drunk and take off my clothes/ to sign my book for you." One poem adapts a form from Billy Collins, another responds (by name) to Sharon Olds: others recall the candid representations of (for example) Molly Peacock.

Goebel's heart-hurt, ultra-adrenalized alter ego leads us on a raucous RV romp across what's left of postmodern America and beyond. Whether it's gobbling magic cacti at a native ceremony in Northern California, burning bad manuscripts in a backyard bonfire in East Texas, or travelling at top speed to an infamous editor's office in Manhattan (with a burnt-out barista and an illegal bald eagle as companions), scene by scene, story by story, Goebel plunges us into a madly original fictional realm characterized by heartbroken psychedelic cowboys on the brink&#x2014;onely men who wrestle wild dogs on cheap beaches and kick horses in the face to get ahead.&nbsp; <i>Fourteen Stories, None of Them Are Yours</i>&nbsp;is a rare book: Goebel's ingenuity, humanity, and humor streak through every page.</p><p><b>Luke B.

We have here the fine coherence of the not-deliberately incoherent, a proud-standing mess, like a Faulkner mess.

Portraying this world in his paintings, drawings , posters and prints, Lautrec created a vibrant body of art that earned him lasting renown. Lautrec was born in 1864 into one of the oldest noble families in France. At the age of 13 it was discovered that he suffered from a genetic defect that prevented the bones in his legs from continuing to grow. Small in stature and singular in appearance, Lautrec lived his life with a passionate intensity, choosing to dwell among the Bohemian and exotic characters he depicted in his canvases. He died at the age of 37 after excessive drinking had severely debilitated and finally destroyed him. During his short career, however, he not only painted, drew, and designed posters, but also worked with stained glass and bookbindings. The essays in this book discuss the full range of Lautrec&#39;s career and artistic activities - from his youthful sketchbooks and examples of applied art to the seminal pictures and posters at the end of his life. The essays also focus on the cultural milieu and social history of the period, analyzing the marketplace in which Lautec worked, the implications of his exhibitions and his association with other artists, designers and literary figures. The book is the catalogue for an exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London from October 10, 1991 to January 19, 1992 and at the Grand Palais in Paris from February 18 to June 1992.</p><p>The author: Matthias Arnold, born in 1947, wrote his doctoral thesis on Vincent van Gogh.

It was clear that An Loc would be the scene of the next major North Vietnamese effort. A lot was at stake. Not only were the lives of the South Vietnamese soldiers and their American advisers on the line, but so too was the prestige of the South Vietnamese government. The loss of a province so close to Saigon would be a disastrous loss of face for President Thieu and his administration. From the American perspective, the battle would be the supreme test of Vietnamization and President Nixon&#x2019;s policies in Vietnam. More than that, however, was the fact that very little stood between the North Vietnamese and Saigon except the forces at An Loc." &#x2014;from The Battle of An Loc</p><p>With the knowledge born of firsthand experience, James H. Willbanks tells the story of the 60-day siege of An Loc. In 1972, late in the Vietnam War, a small group of South Vietnamese held off three North Vietnamese divisions and helped prevent a direct attack on Saigon. The battle can be considered one of the major events during the gradual American exit from Vietnam. An advisor to the South Vietnamese during the battle, Willbanks places the battle in the context of the shifting role of the American forces and a policy decision to shift more of the burden of fighting the war onto the Vietnamese troops. He presents an overview of the 1972 North Vietnamese Easter Offensive, a plan to press forward the attack on U.S. and ARVN positions throughout the country, including Binh Long province and Saigon. The North Vietnamese hoped to strike a decisive blow at a time when most American troops were being withdrawn. The heart of Willbanks&#x2019;s account concentrates on the fighting in Binh Long province, Saigon, and the siege of An Loc. It concludes with a discussion of the Paris peace talks, the significance of the fighting at An Loc, and the eventual fall of South Vietnam.</p><p>Twentieth-Century Battles&#x2014;Spencer C.

Kerrigan's moody, unsettling tale explores the criminal underside of Dublin and, by extension, the dark, hidden face of twenty-first-century Ireland. The plot follows several stories: a woman tries to mug a pair of tourists with a syringe as her weapon; a man plans a jewelry heist; a gangster's life is torn apart by his brother's murder; a detective builds a case against an accused rapist. Kerrigan, a veteran journalist who lives in Dublin, presents his city as almost schizophrenic: on the one hand it's newly revitalized, refreshed, striding boldly into the future; on the other, just under the surface, it's seedy, falling apart, a throwback to a violent past. There is no attempt to reconcile these two very different Dublins; rather, Kerrigan makes the point that, despite cosmetic changes, the city has stayed pretty much the same.

Fanthorpe's Christmas Poems gathers together the poems she wrote and sent to friends as Christmas cards from 1974 to 2002. Now readers can enjoy Fanthorpe's yearly output in its entirety. Her subject matter covers a broad range of seasonal characters, from angels to personified Christmas trees, and a variety of styles to match, from moments of beautiful lyricism to the comically touching Gloucestershire foxes begging baby Jesus to visit: 'Come live wi we under Westridge / Where the huntin folk be few'. Fanthorpe is witty and highly original, rethinking the Christmas story from quirky angles, to create her own alternative Christmas legend &#x2013; from the cat and the sheep-dog left out of the stable, to the wicked fairy's gifts for Jesus. Above all, these poems are celebrations of Christmas joy and love.</p><p>U. A. Fanthorpe (1929-2009) was born in Kent and read English at St Anne&#x2019;s College, Oxford, before training as a teacher. She was Head of English at Cheltenham Ladies&#x2019; College, and then became a middle-aged drop-out in order to write&#x2019;, publishing her first collection, Side Effects, in 1978. Her eight volumes of poetry were all published by Peterloo, and her Selected Poems was published by Penguin in 1986. Enitharmon Press publish her Christmas Poems and From Me to You, love poems by Fanthorpe and R. V. Bailey. In 1994 U. A. Fanthorpe was the first woman to be nominated for the post of Professor of Poetry at Oxford. She was awarded the CBE in 2001 and the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 2003, when her Collected Poems were published. In 2010 Enitharmon published her definitive volume New and Collected Poems which features a preface by The Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.&#34;Fanthorpe is a national treasure. A new book from her is always a unique pleasure to be savoured for its truth, disconcerting obliqueness and even more disconcerting directness.&#34;</p><h2>The Holy Innocents</h2><p>In May 1968, a brother and sister, young, clever and aristocratic, and incestuously involved, become friends with an American who is studying film in Paris. When their parents go on vacation, they invite the American to stay with them in their flat, where they start to play games.</p><p>The title characters of this rich, furiously concentrated first novel, set in Paris during the student uprisings of 1968, are 17-year-old twins Guillaume and Danielle and their friend Matthew, a 19-year-old American film student studying at the Cinematheque Francaise. Living in a huge apartment and virtually unnoticed by their father and his new wife, bored sophisticates Guillaume and Danielle pursue an obsessive incestuous relationship that becomes even more complicated when sexually confused Matthew moves in; in the author's deft phrasing, he is in love "with the single person Guillaume and Danielle would have been had they not been born twins." On their own, the three explore avenues of homosexuality, rape, incest and sadism that pull them away from the outside world and into starved, frightened squalor. When they finally reemerge, the Paris they see is almost unrecognizable. Adair depicts this scorching sexual triangle and the games that lead into it with knife-point psychological precision and gorgeously spun prose, but he also portrays the teenagers with a compassion that keeps the title (a reference to Cocteau's The Holy Terrors , which parallels and clearly inspires this work) from being wholly ironic. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Never Smile at a Monkey: And 17 Other Important Things to Remember</h2><p>Title: Never Smile at a Monkey( And 17 Other Important Things to Remember) &lt;&gt;Binding: Hardcover &lt;&gt;Author: SteveJenkins &lt;&gt;Publisher: HoughtonMifflin</p><p><b>Product Description</b><br> When it comes to wild animals, everyone knows that there are certain things you just don't do.

Most see their Roman Catholic traditions and the Christian faith as one and the same. Yet the sad fact is that there are vast differences between Catholicism and Christianity. Christianity was founded not as an institution but as a witness to Jesus Christ. It is Christ, not Christianity, that has the power to change lives. Catholicism arose from the ruins of the Holy Roman Empire. It brought itself to power through the glory of Rome by deception and force. And by force and bloodshed it has maintained that power throughout the years. Millions of people around the world are following an institution, without the slightest understanding of the saving grace of Jesus Christ. This powerful new book examines each of the basic tenets of Catholicism and compares them against the standards and precepts of the Word of God. It is an enlightening look behind the scenes into the history of the Catholic church and the establishment of its power throughout the ages. It is also a book of hope and promise as it lays bare the institution and proclaims the person of Jesus Christ. It is a book that every Catholic must read and every Christian should read.</p><p></p><h2>Man Who Japed</h2><p>Another great story by an amazing author!</p><p><b>The Man Who Japed</b> is Dick's mesmerizing and terrifying tale of a society so eager for order that it will sacrifice anything, including its freedom. Newer York is a post-holocaust city governed by the laws of an oppressively rigid morality. Highly mobile and miniature robots monitor the behavior of every citizen, and the slightest transgression can spell personal doom. Allen Purcell is one of the few people who has the capacity to literally change the way of the world, and once he's offered a high-profile job that acts as guardian of public ethics, he sets out to do precisely that. But first he must deal with the head in his closet."Dick is entertaining us about reality and madness, time and death, sin and salvation." &#x2014;Ursula K. LeGuin</p><h2>Countdown to the Second Coming</h2><p>At last, a book that presents in a concise manner the events leading up to the return of Christ. Dave Hunt, in his characteristic direct style, answers these pervasive questions: Who is the Antichrist? How will he be recognized? What current events indicate that we really are in the last of the &#34;last days&#34;? Using Scripture and up-to-date information, Dave draws the exciting conclusion that, indeed, time is short. He then outlines a biblical response and reminds the reader of the hope we have in Christ. This book instructs, encourages, warns, and strengthens readers to &#34;walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil&#34; (Ephesians 5:15,16).</p><p>Dave Hunt ministered worldwide for nearly forty years, encouraging millions of believers to diligently study God's Word and leading many to Christ.

Dave has condensed a difficult topic into an affordable, easy-to-read booklet. I've bought several and given them away. <br> <br> Warning: this book is not politically correct nor does it paint a rose-colored-glasses-view of the world situation. For that reason, many might be offended. But if you would know the significance of what you see in your evening news and in the newspaper, especially regarding Israel and Jerusalem, then this book is for you. You'll want to keep a Bible handy so you can look up all the verse references; I suggest a King James, New King James, or New American Standard Bible. <br> <br> Various topics such as Israel, Jerusalem, the Antichrist, the Second Coming, the Rapture, the signs of the times, the deception of the ecumenical movements that compromise the Gospel, Israel's rebirth, Islam and the Arab nations' wars on Israel, false peace, etc., are all covered here. <br> <br> Those who want to know will be informed. Those who don't will find many reasons to dislike this book.

In the autumn of 1876, nineteen year-old orphan Esperanza Gorst arrives at the great country house of Evenwood to become a lady's maid to the twenty-sixth Baroness Tansor. But Esperanza is no ordinary servant. She has been sent by her guardian, the mysterious Madame de l'Orme, to uncover the secrets that her new mistress has sought to conceal, and to set right a past injustice in which Esperanza's own life is bound up. At Evenwood she meets Lady Tansor's two dashing sons, Perseus and Randolph, and finds herself enmeshed in a complicated web of seduction, intrigue, deceit, betrayal, and murder. Few writers are as gifted at evoking the sensibility of the nineteenth century as Michael Cox, who has made the world of Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins his own.</p><p>Michael Cox&nbsp;(1948-2009) was the biographer of the ghost-story writer and scholar M. R. James. His first novel, The Meaning of Night, was shortlisted for the 2007 Costa First Novel Award.<b>Act One<br>A House of Secrets<br></b><br>I wish you, first of all, to imagine that you are standing beside me, peeping over the rail of an arched and curtained gallery, set &#x2014; like the stage of some aerial theatre &#x2014; high above a long and imposing room. From our vantage point, if we push our noses out just a very little way through the narrow gap in the curtains, we may see down to where the assembled company of fine ladies and gentlemen are sitting at table. The thick velvet curtains smell of time and dust, but do not mind them. We shall not be here long.<br><br>The room below us, decorated in crimson and gold, is richly furnished and, though grandly proportioned, deliciously warm, even on this chill November evening, from the heat thrown out from blazing piles of pine logs in the two great stone fire-places.<br><br>. . . . <br><br>We now come to the three members of this evening&#x2019;s party in which I &#x2014; and you &#x2014; have a particular interest: the permanent residents of this great house.<br><br>First, of course, my Lady &#x2014; the former Miss Emily Carteret, now the 26th Baroness Tansor.<br><br>Look at her. She sits at the head of the board, as a queen ought, in black and shimmering silver silk. Who can deny that she is beautiful still, or that her fifty-two years have been uncommonly kind to her? In the candlelight below us, fluttering shadows play delightfully across her pale skin (she never allows the gas to be lit: candlelight is so much more flattering).<br><br>She captivates and charms the men gathered in her Crimson-and-Gold Dining-Room. See how they ogle her when they think no one else is looking! Mr FitzMaurice, Dr Pordage, even red-faced Sir Lionel Voysey (always comically maladroit in her presence): they all fall under her spell like silly boys, and see her only as she wishes to be seen.<br>Naturally, her famously tragical past &#x2014; a father murdered, and the great love of her life slain a month before their marriage &#x2014; only increases her allure. Men, I think, are such fools, at least men such as these. If she has suffered, well, there is suffering enough in the world, and we shall each have our share before we are released.<br>Yet she has been richly compensated for her suffering, which is by no means the least of her attractions, especially to her bachelor admirers. Beautiful, romantically scarred by tragedy, the possessor of an immense fortune and an ancient title &#x2014; and now a widow! <br><br>. . . .<br><br>The truth is that she will never marry again, and certainly not a prize fool like Mr Maurice FitzMaurice. <br><br>Marriage would bring her no material advantage. Nor will she succumb to Love again, for her heart is shut fast against all further assault from that quarter. No man can ever displace the memory of her first and last love, whose terrible death is the great affliction of her life, greater even than the murder of her father. Her late husband, Colonel Zaluski, could not do it &#x2014; that at least is the common opinion. I never met the gentleman; but Sukie Prout (my great friend below stairs) says that the two of them rubbed along well enough, and that the Colonel had a smiling, accommodating way about him that made you instantly like him. I must suppose, therefore, that his wife liked him too, and that this was enough for her. <br><br>The fruits of this unremarkable union are now sitting on either side of their mother: Mr Perseus Duport, the heir to her title and fortune, on her right hand, his younger brother, Mr Randolph Duport, on her left. But <i>they</i> are not at all unremarkable. <br><br>Mr Perseus &#x2014; who has just raised a toast to gallant Lord Edward Duport &#x2014; will shortly attain his majority, and is very like his mother in appearance: tall, deliberate in movement, watchful in attitude, and with the same fathomless eyes. His hair &#x2014; as dark as those eyes &#x2014; is worn long, so that it falls about his shoulders in a consciously romantic way, as befits the poet he aspires to be. He is very proud of his hair, a trait that he also gets from his mother. A most handsome young gentleman, undoubtedly, made more so by a carefully tended black beard, which gives him a dangerously heroic look, exactly like the portrait of the Turkish Corsair that hangs at the foot of the vestibule stairs, and for which, on first seeing it, I thought he must have sat, had it not been painted over twenty years since. <br><br>His younger brother, Mr Randolph Duport, is nearly twenty, and is no less striking than his brother, though very differently composed. He is shorter and stockier, stronger in limb, with warm brown eyes (Sukie says they are the spit of his late father&#x2019;s), a rosy, outdoors colouring, and unruly brown hair. There is not the least resemblance to his mother; nor is there any discernible trace of her temperament in him, which makes people like him far more than Mr Perseus. Unlike his brother, he has none of Lady Tansor&#x2019;s haughtiness and pride. He is, by contrast, a singularly unaffected and spontaneous soul, appearing to take things as they come, and (so goes the general opinion) hardly ever thinking of consequences, for which I am told he has often felt the sting of his mother&#x2019;s displeasure. Yet, possessing the uncommon ability to acknowledge his faults, which Mr Perseus appears to lack, he is said never to complain, but promises to apply himself more soberly in the future to the art of properly considering matters.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>These three persons have become the principal and constant objects of my attention in this house, to which I have been sent for reasons that &#x2014; at the time of which I am writing &#x2014; have not been fully revealed to me. Thus I continue to wait, and watch, as I have been instructed to do.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Road to Ehvenor (Guardians of the Flame)</h2><p>As magic from Faerie begins to creep into This Side, the border town of Ehvenor becomes the site of a battle between Jason Cullinane&#39;s warriors and the invading forces of sorcery. Original.</p><p><p>Joel Rosenberg was born in 1954. The author of many science fiction and fantasy novels, he is best known for his Guardians of the Flame fantasy series. He lives in Minneapolis with his wife Felicia, two daughters, one sister, five cats, one dog and a couple of dozen fish.</p>The moderately involving sixth installment in the Guardians of the Flame series, following The Warrior Lives , finds Walter Slovotsky, the dwarf Ahira, wizard Andrea Cullinane and her son Jason on the road to Ehvenor to find out why the world of Faerie appears to be increasing its disruptive incursions into Eren, the world of men. They are also searching for Mikyn, Jason's childhood friend, who appears to have taken on the identity of the Warrior (originally Jason's father, Karl) and begun indiscriminately killing slave owners. The rescue of Walter's associates from Home, the settlement devoted to developing Earth technology in Eren, nearly leads to the group's destruction. But they finally reach Ehvenor, only to find an even more dangerous mission involving a malignant spirit (or faerie lord) and Faerie's chaotic, vastly different natural laws. Rosenberg's continuing saga of seven fantasy-game players translated from Earth to a magic-ridden medieval land has its moments, training a wry modern sensibility on unsavory practices like slave trading. Unfortunately, as is the case with many series, it will be difficult for new readers to drop in at this point and find their bearings, although a few hints are vouchsafed. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Broken Structures: Severe Personality Disorders and Their Treatment</h2><p>This book integrates psychiatry and psychoanalysis to present deeper and sounder clinical profiles of the personality disorders than have been hitherto available.</p><p>This landmark volume synthesizes the vast descriptive and dynamic literature on the phenomenology and treatment of severe personality disorders. Among the psychoanalytic authors whose views are included are: . the &#34;pioneers&#34; such as Freud, Abraham, Ferenczi, Jones, Fenichel, and Reich; the &#34;second generation&#34; analysts such as Klein, Anna Freud, Fairbairn, Balint, Winnicott, Guntrip, Erikson, Waelder, Greenacre, Jacobson, Menninger, and Eissler; and the contemporary theorists such as Mahler, Kohut, Kernberg, Khan, Blos, Blum, Modell, Volkan, Adler, Kramer, Bach, Meissner, Burland, Singer, and Chasseguet-Smirgel. Among the descriptive psychiatrists included are: . the founding fathers of descriptive psychiatry such as Kraepelin, Magnan, Kretschmer, Bleuler, Schneider, and Jaspers; later investigators such as Maudsley, Cleckley, Langfeldt, Leonhard, Sheldon, Hoch, and Polatin; and contemporary observers such as Fish, Winokur, Spitzer, Gunderson, Frances, Kendler, Stone, Reid, Livesley, Akiskal, Perry, and Klerman. Combining the observations of these prominent analysts and empirical researchers leads to the sound clinical profiles of eight severe personality disorders - narcissistic, borderline, schizoid, paranoid, hypomanic, antisocial, histrionic, and schizotypal - contained in this book. Akhtar provides a rich harvest of evaluative procedures and therapeutic techniques. In the initial evaluation he combines traditional history taking with a penetrating examination of the patient&#39;s sense of identity, ego defenses, object relations, and psychological-mindedness. This enables the clinician to choose the most effective therapeutic strategies. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is discussed indetail, including the synthesis of diverse approaches as well as the addition of environmental and supportive measures. This is an important exploration of the mutual interdependence of psychiatry and psychoanalysis and makes a major contribution to the understanding and psychotherapy of the personality disorders.Salman Akhtar, M.D. , is Professor of Psychiatry at Jefferson Medical College, Lecturer on Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and Training and Supervising Analyst at the Philadelphia Psychoanalytic Institute. He is the Book Review Editor of the Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, an associate editor of the Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research, member of the editorial board of the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, past member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, and an editorial reader for Psychoanalytic Quarterly.</p><h2>An Illustrated Gardener&#39;s Notebook (Illustrated Notebooks)</h2><p>Always a series denoting value and quality, the &#34;Illustrated Notebooks&#34; are now a good thing made better!

Oklahoma and the Near-Triumph of American Eugenics</h2><p><p><strong>The disturbing, forgotten history of America&#x2019;s experiment with eugenics.</strong></p> In the 1920s and 1930s, thousands of men and women were sterilized at asylums and prisons across America. Believing that criminality and mental illness were inherited, state legislatures passed laws calling for the sterilization of &#x201c;habitual criminals&#x201d; and the &#x201c;feebleminded.&#x201d; But in 1936, inmates at Oklahoma&#x2019;s McAlester prison refused to cooperate; a man named Jack Skinner was the first to come to trial. A colorful and heroic cast of characters&#x2015;from the inmates themselves to their devoted, self-taught lawyer&#x2015;would fight the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Only after Americans learned the extent of another large-scale eugenics project&#x2015;in Nazi Germany&#x2015;would the inmates triumph. Combining engrossing narrative with sharp legal analysis, Victoria F. Nourse explains the consequences of this landmark decision, still vital today&#x2015;and reveals the stories of these forgotten men and women who fought for human dignity and the basic right to have a family.</p><p>Victoria F. Nourse received her JD degree from the University of California, Berkeley. Currently the Burrus-Bascom Professor of Criminal and Constitutional Law at the University of Wisconsin, she lives in Shorewood, Wisconsin.*Starred Review* Nourse blows the dust off one of the most momentous forgotten decisions in Supreme Court history, whose import for society is easily appreciated but whose rationale must be not just dusted off but salvaged and restored. Under the influence of the eugenics movement&#x2019;s promises of an improved humanity, Oklahoma, like many other states, passed laws in the 1920s and 1930s authorizing the sexual sterilization of people of low intelligence, mental patients, and criminals.&nbsp;The first Oklahoma convict targeted for compulsory vasectomy, Jack Skinner became&nbsp;the plaintiff in a case that would effectually overturn legal sterilization in the U.S. From filing to Supreme Court decision took six years (1936&#x2013;42) and, as Nourse demonstrates, involved state politics, classic underdog advocacy,&nbsp;riots and breakouts by frightened convicts,&nbsp;and FDR&#x2019;s attempt to pack the high court, but not any rights talk, even of the human right to reproduce. Back then, community interests and duly enacted laws generally trumped appeals to personal rights. Skinner v. Oklahoma was decided by arguments about the evenhandedness of Oklahoma&#x2019;s convict-sterilization law. The justices concluded that the statute was discriminatory, not inhumane. Americans would do well to recall Skinner&#x2019;s egalitarianism, Nourse says, as the persuasiveness of rights talk wanes. Completely engrossing, this may be the legal-history book of the year. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Ellie&#39;s Long Walk: The True Story of Two Friends on the Appalachian Trail</h2><p><p>Ellie, a formerly abandoned puppy, and her new owner set out to hike the more than 2,000 mile long Appalachian Trail.

The first national medium of mass communication, these journals had a formitive influence on American culture. Many of their garden articles were by authors we recognize today as singularly fascinating voices: Louise Beebe Wilder, Grace Tabor, Fletcher Steele, Wilhelm Miller, and Mrs. Francis King. But some of the best were by amatuers who wrote about their gardens with wonderful enthusiasm and intelligence while earning their livings in other professions. <p>Virginia Clayton has selected over fifty of these marvels of garden prose and arranged them in chapters covering everything from "Wild Gardens" and "Formal Gardens" to "A Year in the Garden." The book also includes photographs from the articles themselves, as well as a color plate section reproducing twenty-one glorious magazine covers. </p><p>This is truly the book for the "once and future gardener," a delightful and authoritative reference work that no serious gardener, or garden historian, should be without.</p></p><p>Virginia Clayton is an Associate Curator at the National Gallery of Art.Clayton, associate curator of old master prints at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, introduces this anthology with a succinct history of the literature of amateur gardening and of gardening in mainstream magazines. The 59 articles she has chosen from popular pre-World War II titles such as The House Beautiful and Country Life in America cover a broad range of topics. There are literary essays by well-known professionals as well as more practical ones by amateur gardeners whose advice is often still useful. The somewhat artificial organization is by chapters ranging from "A Year in the Garden" to "Formal, Italian Gardens and the Use of Architectural Features and Furnishings." Clayton provides capsule biographies of the authors and places each selection in its historical context. Reprints of the black-and-white illustrations, plus color plates of some of the magazine covers, add to the reader's pleasure.

He is a multiple Nebula Award finalist who lives in Georgia with his wife Maureen.</p>Set in the 23rd century, this straightforward adventure from Nebula-finalist McDevitt (Omega) explores the immorality of big business and the short-sightedness of the American government in minimizing support for space travel. These destructive forces are held off by the insight and brilliance of individuals such as the influential Gregory MacAllister, editor of a non-partisan journal, The Nation, and Priscilla "Hutch" Hutchins, manager of a government-sponsored space-research agency, the Academy. While often on opposite sides of support for the Academy's research budget, MacAllister and Hutch together uncover and react to evidence that Orion Tours' CEO, Charles Dryden, is engaged in a massive conspiracy to jump-start his intergalactic tour business. MacAllister unmasks the others supporting Dryden's faked alien attacks, targeting a physicist who colluded in the hoax. His skepticism about space travel, however, prevents him from seeing the existence of real aliens, something Hutch must pursue at risk to her career. Subtract the "inspirational quotations" and the newspaper headlines appended to some chapters, and what's left is enough space travel, heroics and speculation about the history of the universe to satisfy most hard SF enthusiasts.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He reported that a &#x201c;change" is coming; a future when very human-like hybrids would intermingle with humans in everyday life. &#x201c;Soon we will all be together,&#x201d; the aliens said. &#x201c;Soon everyone will be happy and everyone will know his place.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p>This audiobook examines a chilling phenomenon that Jacobs began noticing in 2003. The alien integration action plan has kicked into high gear. The incidents of alien abductions have declined as occurrences of alien involvement in everyday life have accelerated. A silent and insidious invasion has begun. Alien hybrids have moved into your neighborhood and into your workplace. They have been trained by human abductees to &#x201c;pass,&#x201d; to blend in to society, to appear as normal as your next door neighbor.</p><p></p><p>This audiobook illustrates in detail the process of alien integration into society and the strategy and support structure that has been developed to make this happen seamlessly. While he is not certain why they are doing it, the final chapter of the audiobook will provide some chilling possible answers as to why they are here and what they want to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>Jacobs is a careful researcher who has investigated more than 1150 abduction events experienced by more than 150 abductees.

Julie Powell, nearing thirty and trapped in a dead-end secretarial job, resolves to reclaim her life by cooking in the span of a single year, every one of the 524 recipes in Julia Child's legendary <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i>. Her unexpected reward: not just a newfound respect for calves' livers and aspic, but a new life-lived with gusto. The film is written and directed by Nora Ephron and stars Amy Adams as Julie and Meryl Streep as Julia.</p><p><i>Julie &amp; Julia</i> is the story of Julie Powell's attempt to revitalize her marriage, restore her ambition, and save her soul by cooking all 524 recipes in Julia Child's <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume I</i>, in a period of 365 days. The result is a masterful medley of <i>Bridget Jones' Diary</i> meets <i>Like Water for Chocolate</i>, mixed with a healthy dose of original wit, warmth, and inspiration that sets this memoir apart from most tales of personal redemption. <p> When we first meet Julie, she's a frustrated temp-to-perm secretary who slaves away at a thankless job, only to return to an equally demoralizing apartment in the outer boroughs of Manhattan each evening. At the urging of Eric, her devoted and slightly geeky husband, she decides to start a blog that will chronicle what she dubs the "Julie/Julia Project." What follows is a year of butter-drenched meals that will both necessitate the wearing of an unbearably uncomfortable girdle on the hottest night of the year, as well as the realization that life is what you make of it and joy is not as impossible a quest as it may seem, even when it's -10 degrees out and your pipes are frozen. </p><p> Powell is a natural when it comes to connecting with her readers, which is probably why her blog generated so much buzz, both from readers and media alike. And while her self-deprecating sense of humor can sometimes dissolve into whininess, she never really loses her edge, or her sense of purpose. Even on day 365, she's working her way through Mayonnaise Collee and ending the evening "back exactly where we started--just Eric and me, three cats and Buffy...sitting on a couch in the outer boroughs, eating, with Julia chortling alongside us...." </p><p> Inspired and encouraging, <i>Julie and Julia</i> is a unique opportunity to join one woman's attempt to change her life, and have a laugh, or ten, along the way. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>After spending a long, long time working as a temp, Julie Powell now writes in her pajamas at her home in Queens, New York, and occasionally serves as a butcher&#39;s apprentice.</p><h2>Notes of an Alchemist</h2><p>Sm Quarto, , Pp.125, A series of Poems of historic depth and far ranging insight</p><p></p><h2>The causes of war</h2><p>Based on a survey of international wars fought since 1700 and updated in this edition to include the nuclear era, this work examines the causes of war, arguing that the causes of war and peace are closely related and emphasizing factors such as our understanding of why wars begin and end.

She gave a furtive glance across the suburban estate, one of many just like it in Peterborough. Sundraj from number twenty-seven was the only other neighbour outside, guiding his noisy young family-of-four into a people carrier like a farmer trying to herd sheep from one field to another. When he spotted her, he gave her a half-smile and an equally half-hearted wave. She reciprocated with the same.</p><p>Claire recalled Sundraj and his wife Siobhan&#x2019;s fifteenth anniversary party last spring. They&#x2019;d celebrated with a barbecue and most of the street in attendance. He found time to drunkenly corner Claire in the downstairs bathroom and suggested that if she and her husband Ben were ever inclined to invite a third person into their bedroom, he was open to offers. Claire politely declined and he panicked, begging her not to tell Siobhan. She promised she wouldn&#x2019;t, and she meant it. She hadn&#x2019;t even told Ben. Claire wagered every person in that street had at least one secret they kept hidden from the rest of the world, including her. <i>Especially </i>her.</p><p>As Sundraj&#x2019;s vehicle eased out of the cul-de-sac, Claire took a handful of deep, calming breaths and stared uneasily at her own car. It had been three weeks since Ben had signed the lease and she was still struggling to acclimatise herself to its many new functions. The biggest contrast between it and their last vehicle was that this one no longer contained a steering wheel, pedals or a manual override option. It was completely driverless and it scared her.</p><p>They had watched in fascination at the car&#x2019;s arrival as it delivered itself to their home and parked on the driveway. Sensing both Claire&#x2019;s unease and reluctance, Ben assured her anyone could operate it, even her, and that it was &#x201c;idiot proof.&#x201d; As they personalised their settings from an App, she responded with narrowed eyes and a jab to his arm. He protested, claiming he hadn&#x2019;t meant she was the idiot in question.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like not being in control,&#x2019; she&#x2019;d told him on their maiden voyage to the doctor&#x2019;s surgery. She gripped the seat when the car indicated and overtook another one of its own accord.</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;re a control freak,&#x2019; he&#x2019;d replied. &#x2018;You need to learn to start putting your trust in things you&#x2019;re not in charge of. Besides, the insurance is next to nothing and we need to start saving some money, don&#x2019;t we?&#x2019;</p><p>Claire gave a reluctant nod. As a man who thrived on the detail, Ben had spent considerable time and effort researching the right vehicle to suit their changing circumstances. And after a hellish few months, she was glad to see him returning to his old self. He had attempted to involve her in the process by suggesting she pick the paintwork colour and seating fabric. But she&#x2019;d dismissed him as a misogynist for suggesting that buying a car was &#x201c;man&#x2019;s work&#x201d; and that the aesthetics were all she was capable of understanding. In the last few days, Claire found herself snapping at him frequently. It was never his fault and she&#x2019;d immediately regretted it. But it hadn&#x2019;t prevented her from repeating it and she feared her quiet resentment towards him was rising ever closer to the surface.</p><p>The rear of the car momentarily held Claire&#x2019;s gaze before a dull kick to her kidney snapped her from her thoughts. &#x2018;Good morning,&#x2019; she whispered and rubbed her swollen, rounded abdomen. It was the first time baby Tate had made his presence felt that morning. They had given him the nickname after the midwife informed them he weighed about a pound, the same size as a Tate &amp; Lyle bag of sugar. However, what started as a joke had stuck and they were giving it serious consideration.</p><p>Provided all went according to plan, in two month&#x2019;s time, Claire would be a first-time mother. Dr Barraclough had warned her that with her high blood pressure, it was essential she kept life stress-free. It was easier said than done. And in the last few hours, it had become impossible.</p><p>&#x2018;You can do this,&#x2019; she said aloud and opened the car door. Claire placed her handbag on the front right-hand seat and lowered herself into the vehicle, bum first. Her expectant belly had begun to protrude much earlier than her friends when they were pregnant and sometimes it felt as if she was carrying a baby elephant. Her body was constantly contradicting itself &#x2013; some parts sagged while others looked fit to burst.</p><p>She pressed a button to close the car door and faced the retina scan. Taking a quick glance at her appearance, Claire noted her blue eyes were surrounded by a pinkish white hue and the dark circles around them were still visible under her foundation. She&#x2019;d not straightened her blonde bangs that morning so they hung loosely, resting on her eyebrows.</p><p>Once the scan confirmed Claire was a registered Passenger, the electric motor silently came to life and the dashboard&#x2019;s centre console and operating system illuminated in whites and blues. &#x2018;Ben&#x2019;s work,&#x2019; she spoke, and a three-dimensional map appeared on the screen from her home to his office several miles outside of town.</p><p>As the car began to move, she jumped when a playlist of 1990s rock anthems blared from the speakers without warning. She hated Ben&#x2019;s appalling taste in music and the volume at which he played it. But she had yet to figure out how to turn off his streaming system and create playlists of her own. Then, as the opening bars began of an old Arctic Monkeys song Ben favoured, she failed to choke back her tears. He knew every word of it off by heart.</p><p>&#x2018;Why did you do this to us?&#x2019; she wept. &#x2018;Why now?&#x2019;</p><p>Claire wiped her eyes and cheeks with her palms, turned the music off and remained in an apprehensive silence as the car continued its journey. She ran through the to-do list again; there was so much she needed to complete by the afternoon for this to work. She kept reminding herself that everything she was doing was for the right reasons; it was all for Tate. And as much as she longed to meet him, a tiny part of her wanted him to remain safe inside her forever, where she could continue to protect him from the cruelty of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>She glanced out from the windscreen just as the vehicle turned an unexpected right instead of left, the opposite direction to Ben&#x2019;s office on the outskirts of Peterborough. Claire squinted at the route map on the navigation system, sure that she had programmed it correctly. Then she remembered Ben telling her that sometimes, driverless cars take alternative routes if they learn of delays ahead. She hoped it wouldn&#x2019;t add much more time to the journey. The sooner she could get out of that car the better.</p><p>Suddenly the console went blank. Claire hesitated, then poked at it, jabbing random icons and searching for a way to reboot it. It made no difference.</p><p>&#x2018;Damn it,&#x2019; she muttered. Of all the days, this was not the one to be inside a faulty vehicle. The car chose another route, this time travelling along a slip road and on to a dual carriageway that she knew would take her even further from her destination.&nbsp;</p><p>She began to feel uneasy. &#x2018;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x2019; she asked and cursed Ben&#x2019;s decision to talk her into a car with no manual override. She poked more buttons in the hope something might happen to allow her to regain control and order the car to pull over.</p><p>&#x201c;Alternative destination being programmed,&#x201d; came a softly spoken female voice that Claire recognised as the vehicle&#x2019;s operating system. &#x201c;Route being recalculated. Two hours and thirty minutes until chosen destination reached.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; Claire responded. &#x2018;No! Where are we going?&#x2019;</p><p>As the car pulled up at traffic lights, she spotted her chance to leave. Quickly, she unclipped her seatbelt and hit the door release button. Once outside, she would compose herself and rethink her plan. She knew that whatever alternative she came up with, she could not leave the car unattended, not under any circumstances. However, the door held firm. Over and over again she pushed it, harder and harder but it wouldn&#x2019;t budge. Her baby kicked again.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;ll be okay, it&#x2019;ll be okay,&#x2019; she repeated, trying to convince them both she could find a way out.</p><p>Claire&#x2019;s head turned towards the car next to hers at the traffic lights and waved her hands to catch the driver&#x2019;s attention. But he was too distracted by a film playing on his Smart windscreen. Her wave became more and more frantic until finally, she caught his eye. He turned his head towards her, but within the speed of a heartbeat, her windows switched from transparent to opaque. The privacy control had been set remotely so that no-one could witness her desperation.</p><p>Terror overtook her when she finally realised what was happening - someone else was controlling her car.</p><p>&#x2018;Good morning Claire,&#x2019; a male voice began through the speakers.</p><p>She let out an involuntary scream. The voice was calm and relaxed, friendly almost, but most definitely unwelcome. &#x2018;It may have come to your attention that your vehicle is no longer under your management,&#x2019; it continued. &#x2018;From here on in, I am in charge of your destination.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x2018;Who are you?&#x2019; Claire asked. &#x2018;What do you want?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Neither of those things matter right now,&#x2019; the voice replied. &#x2018;The only thing you need to know at this point is that in two hours and thirty minutes from now, it is highly likely that you will be dead.&#x2019;</p><b><br></b><p><b>CHAPTER 2</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>JUDE HARRISON</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jude Harrison&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on the charger leading from the wall and plugged into the grille of his car.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t be sure for how long he had been sitting in the vehicle, staring at the charging point or why it had captured his attention. Realising he&#x2019;d lost all track of time, he checked the clock on his dashboard. To remain on schedule, he would need to start moving soon. His eyes flicked towards the battery cell light &#x2013; ten minutes remained before it reached its capacity. The distance he was to travel wouldn&#x2019;t require a complete charge, but anything less than at least three-quarters full made him jittery.</p><p>Most other vehicles in the supermarket car park charged in smarter ways than his. They topped up using on-the-go over chargers embedded in the asphalt of traffic lights, roundabouts, parking spaces or even drive-thru fast-food outlets. Jude had purchased his driverless car at the beginning of the government&#x2019;s much hyped &#x201c;road revolution.&#x201d; Overnight, he went from a driver to a Passenger - someone whose vehicle contained no manual override. The car made all the decisions itself. Compared to many, his model was now out-dated and soon it would cease to automatically download the software that operated it, thus forcing him to upgrade. He&#x2019;d been offered financial incentives to purchase a more advanced, hi-tech model but he refused. It was pointless spending money on something he would not need for much longer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jude&#x2019;s belly made a deep, guttural rumbling, reminding him it wanted to be fed. He knew that he must eat to keep his energy levels up and get him through the morning. But he had little appetite, not even for the chocolatey snacks he kept in the side pouches of the luggage on the seats behind him. Exiting the car, he made his way into the supermarket, but towards the bathroom, not the food aisles. There, he emptied his bowels in the toilet, washed his hands and face and dried them under the wall-mounted machine. He removed from his pocket a disposable toothbrush containing paste that foamed up once it mixed with his saliva and began to clean his teeth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harsh lighting above the mirror reflected from his scalp and emphasised how thin the hair was becoming around his temples. He&#x2019;d recently begun keeping it cropped rather than trying to style and hide it. He remembered his father warning him and his brother that he had begun receding by his thirtieth birthday, and Jude was following suit. His friends took medication to keep their hair in place; Jude rejected it along with all popular cosmetic alterations. He hadn&#x2019;t even fixed the two bottom teeth that leaned against one another, which meant he always smiled with closed lips.</p><p>It had been the best part of a week since he&#x2019;d last run a razor across his face and it made his olive complexion appear darker. Despite his fatigue, the whites of his eyes remained bright and made his green irises resemble the colour of ripe apples. He placed the palms of his hands on his T-shirt and traced the outline of his stomach and ribs with his fingers. He was aware of the weight he&#x2019;d lost over the last month and blamed the pressure on all that needed to be organised for this day to be a success.</p><p>He looked to his wrist for the time, forgetting he had long discarded his watch. It had gathered details from his pulse and temperature to reveal his metabolism, blood pressure and many other diagnosis&#x2019;s he didn&#x2019;t care to be informed about. He didn&#x2019;t need to read the digits on a display to know his stress levels were soaring.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jude returned to his car and once satisfied the battery was now full, he unplugged the recharger and took the first of a handful of deep breaths before climbing inside and informing the vehicle&#x2019;s voice-activated operating system of his next destination.</p><p>The car began cruising the suburban roads at no more than twenty-five miles an hour as Jude recalled how much he used to enjoy being in sole control of a vehicle. He passed his driving test on his seventeenth birthday and at the time, it had felt like the greatest achievement in the world, giving him the freedom he craved. He could leave at will the confines of the village in which he was born and raised. He was no longer reliant on irregular bus timetables, his parents or older brother to give him glimpses of the outside world. It didn&#x2019;t sit comfortably with him that nowadays, children of fourteen were Passengers in fully autonomous vehicles. It was if they were cheating.</p><p>&nbsp;Jude also remembered a time when roads like these were to be avoided at that time of the morning. They used to be gridlocked with rush hour, bumper-to-bumper traffic. Now, cars glided smoothly through the streets, conversing with each other through a network of internal communication systems to reduce bottlenecks and congestion. As much as he resented these cars, there were some benefits to having one.</p><p>Much of his dashboard was taken up by a soundbar and large interactive OLED screen in which he could control everything from his choice of television viewing to emails, social media, and reading material. He scrolled downwards until he located a blue folder labelled Family Holidays. Inside, he checked a subfolder which read &#x2018;Greece&#x2019; and a selection of videos appear...</p></p><h2>My Stroke of Insight-A Brain Scientist&#39;s Personal Journey</h2><p>This soft cover book has 20 chapters concerning the stroke journey of Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor.

Bruce Ismay</h2><p>Award-winning historian Frances Wilson delivers a gripping new account of the sinking of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>, looking at the collision and its aftermath through the prism of the demolished life and lost honor of the ship&#x2019;s owner, J. Bruce Ismay. In a unique work of history evocative of Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s classic novel <em>Lord Jim</em>, Wilson raises provocative moral questions about cowardice and heroism, memory and identity, survival and guilt&#x2014;questions that revolve around Ismay&#x2019;s loss of honor and identity as his monolithic venture&#x2014;a ship called &#x201c;The Last Word in Luxury&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Unsinkable&#x201d;&#x2014;was swallowed by the sea and subsumed in infamy forever.<br></p><p><p>On April 14, 1912, as one thousand men prepared to die, J.

He survived the ship's sinking&#x2014;but his life and reputation would never recover.</p><p>Examining Ismay through the lens of Joseph Conrad's prophetic novel <em>Lord Jim</em>&#x2014;and using Ismay's letters to the beautiful Marion Thayer, a first-class passenger with whom he had fallen in love during the voyage&#x2014;biographer Frances Wilson explores the shattered shipowner's desperate need to tell his story, to make sense of the horror of it all, and to find a way of living with the consciousness of his lost honor. For those who survived the <em>Titanic</em>, the world was never the same. But as Wilson superbly demonstrates, we all have our own Titanics, and we all need to find ways of surviving them.</p><p>Frances Wilson was educated at Oxford University and lectured on nineteenth- and twentieth-century English literature for fifteen years before becoming a full-time writer. Her books include <em>Literary Seductions: Compulsive Writers and Diverted Readers</em> and <em>The Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth: A Life</em>, which won the British Academy Rose Mary Crawshay Prize.

For Rose Destea, to walk in beauty has meant threading a difficult path between traditionalist and modernist ways. Though she worships at the family shrine, her husband was a Christian preacher. Though her son, Clifford Destea, is a respected hataalii or medicine man, her daughter, Ella Clah, is a Special Investigator with the Navajo Police and a former FBI agent.<br><br>After decades as a wife, mother, and grandmother, Rose has become a tribal activist. Briefly in the national spotlight when she spoke against bringing casino gambling to the Navajo Reservation, Rose now works to guide not just her family but the whole tribe into a balanced future. <br><br>When Navajo healers and members of the Plant Watchers society report that healing plants sacred to the Navajo are disappearing from the Rez, the tribal council asks Rose to catalog the plants and their growing places. She faces strong opposition from hataaliis reluctant to reveal their secret herb-gathering spots and from people who think the Rez should cultivate genetically engineered plants instead of native species. <br>Rose finds evidence that many plants have been stolen-plants that may be valuable in the growing market for alternative and natural medications. Rose's home is burgled and her plant notes stolen. Adding to her worries is the serious illness of an old friend and the apparent extinction of a plant essential to the healing ritual that is the sick woman's only hope of a cure. Then a Navajo man is found dead, apparently of a heart attack; Rose is convinced that he was murdered by the plant thief.<br><br>Rose has picked up a trick or two from her police officer daughter; she begins an independent investigation that soon has her up to her neck in trouble. <br><br><i>Plant Them Deep</i> is a stand-alone novel that complements the Ella Clah series and will deepen readers' understanding of the Navajo world. <br></p><p>"If it's just too long between Tony Hillerman novels, the mysteries of Aim�e and David Thurlo will help you bridge the canyons.

At the same time it satirizes the Civil Service examinations and financial corruption in dealings on the stock market.</p><p>Anthony Trollope&#39;s father, Thomas Anthony Trollope, worked as a barrister. Thomas Trollope, though a clever and well-educated man and a Fellow of New College, Oxford, failed at the bar due to his bad temper. In addition, his ventures into farming proved unprofitable and he lost an expected inheritance when an elderly uncle married and had children. Nonetheless, he came from a genteel background, with connections to the landed gentry, and so wished to educate his sons as gentlemen and for them to attend Oxford or Cambridge. The disparity between his family&#39;s social background and its poverty would be the cause of much misery to Anthony Trollope during his boyhood. Born in London, Anthony attended Harrow School as a day-boy for three years from the age of seven, as his father&#39;s farm lay in that neighbourhood. After a spell at a private school, he followed his father and two older brothers to Winchester College, where he remained for three years. He returned to Harrow as a day-boy to reduce the cost of his education. Trollope had some very miserable experiences at these two public schools. They ranked as two of the most �lite schools in England, but Trollope had no money and no friends, and got bullied a great deal. At the age of twelve, he fantasized about suicide. However, he also daydreamed, constructing elaborate imaginary worlds. In 1827, his mother Frances Trollope moved to America with Trollope&#39;s three younger siblings, where she opened a bazaar in Cincinnati, which proved unsuccessful. Thomas Trollope joined them for a short time before returning to the farm at Harrow, but Anthony stayed in England throughout. His mother returned in 1831 and rapidly made a name for herself as a writer, soon earning a good income. His father&#39;s affairs, however, went from bad to worse. He gave up his legal practice entirely and failed to make enough income from farming to pay rents to his landlord Lord Northwick. In 1834 he fled to Belgium to avoid arrest for debt. The whole family moved to a house near Bruges, where they lived entirely on Frances&#39;s earnings. In 1835, Thomas Trollope died. While living in Belgium, Anthony worked as a Classics usher (a junior or assistant teacher) in a school with a view to learning French and German, so that he could take up a promised commission in an Austrian cavalry regiment, which had to be cut short at six weeks.</p><h2>The Air Combat Paintings of Robert Taylor</h2><p>Volume One, first published in 1987, has sold more copies than any other aviation art book.

The central text of Kabbalah, the Zohar is a commentary on the Bible&#x2019;s narratives, laws, and genealogies and a map of the spiritual landscape. In <b>The Essential Zohar</b>, the eminent kabbalist Rav P. S. Berg decodes its teachings on evil, redemption, human relationships, wealth and poverty, and other fundamental concerns from a practical, contemporary perspective. The Zohar and Kabbalah have traditionally been known as the world&#x2019;s most esoteric sources of spiritual knowledge, but Rav Berg has dedicated his life to making this concentrated distillation of infinite wisdom available to people of all faiths so that we may use its principles to live each day in harmony with the divine.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Kabbalah, often defined as a Jewish mystical tradition, actually encompasses "the spiritual heritage of all mankind," according to Rav P.S. Berg in <i>The Essential Zohar</i>. Berg, the dean of the Kabbalah Centre (whose members include celebrities such as Madonna and Mick Jagger), has concentrated a core of teachings from the central kabbalistic text, the Zohar, in a single volume that makes kabbalistic wisdom accessible to readers of all religious traditions. The Zohar, which dates back to the second century B.C.E., offers tools for doing the work of kabbalah: "transforming chaos and fragmentation into unity and completion." The Zohar's biblical commentaries and rabbinical stories of apparently "surprise happenings, sudden insights, and full-blown epiphanies" are intended to help readers open themselves to similar revelations. And Berg explains that all of the Zohar's rarified spiritual stories have potential for practical application, to help readers "replace doubt with certainty and darkness with Light." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>A kabbalist descended from a lineage of great masters, Rav P. S. Berg was ordained at Torah VaDaat in New York City and later studied under kabbalist Yehuda Brandwein in Israel. As dean and codirector of The Kabbalah Centre, the Rav lectures and teaches internationally, meets with spiritual and world leaders to foster global peace, and has touched the lives of millions through his many books, including <b>Immortality</b>, <b>Wheels of a Soul</b>, <b>To the Power of One</b>, <b>Secret Codes of the Universe</b>, and <b>Education of a Kabbalist</b>.

Intensely readable and characteristically outrageous, they present us with vital and compelling portraits of unforgettable characters: among them, the revolutionary painter Goya, the Frankenstein monster as never glimpsed before, and the Prince of Darkness the Devil himself. </p><p> For readers already familiar with Barker's dark, passionate vision, these plays are invitations to a new kind of reading experience. For those who have not shared his world, they will be a revelation. </p><p> In this extraordinary trio of plays, the same unique imagination that created <i>Everville, Imajica, Hellraiser, Weaveworld, Candymari, The Thief of Always,</i> and the <i>Books of Blood</i> is a work bringing wild new worlds to life. </p><p>Created as epic spectacles for the stage, these immensely readable dramas burst with extraordinary characters, apocalyptic images and violent, often erotic, encounters. </p><p> In <i>Colossus,</i> the subject is the great Spanish painter Goya. Deluging us with an overpowering stream of stage pictures, Barker evokes a world where love, art, cannibalism, and sudden redemption are interwoven. </p><p>In <i>Frankenstein in Love,</i> Barker's homage to Mary Shelley's masterpiece and the shockingly graphic tradition of <i>Grand Guignol</i> theatre, we are invited to a wedding the likes of which the world has never seen. </p><p> In <i>The History of The Devil,</i> Lucifer himself is brought to trial and, clue by clue, we piece together the mystery of Evil Incarnate. </p><p> Dim the lights. Raise the curtain. The stage is set for three journeys into the dark heart of the imagination.</p></p><p>Clive Barker was born in Liverpool, England, in 1952 and now makes his home in Los Angeles, where, in addition to his work as a novelist and short-story writer, he is also a painter and filmmaker.

A Hole in the Heart of the World is both a descent into the still-dark soul of Eastern Europe and a shockingly optimistic chronicle of a fragile cultural and religious birth. In Berlin a prominent Jewish family clings to its Communist ideals even after the end of the Cold War. A West German cantor - and concentration camp survivor - crosses the Berlin Wall to minister to the Jewish remnant in East Berlin. In Hungary a rabbi turns dissident when Communist-controlled Jewish leaders dismiss him, but he continues to teach Hebrew class in his living room, waging an underground war to preserve and nurture Jewish life. Young citizens of Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest find a renewed faith and pride as they uncover a secret heritage buried in the rubble of war and long condemned by the Communist regime. A Polish Catholic woman bears silent witness to the sufferings of her Jewish neighbors during World War II and later discovers something that overturns everything she ever believed about her past.<br>From the old to the young and the disenchanted to the enthusiastic, each arrives, finally, at a place of cultural and religious renewal. A Hole in the Heart of the World is a luminous portrait of the Jewish life that persists, though transformed and tenuous, as a vital element of the European community.</p><p>Jonathan Kaufman is a page-one feature writer for The Wall Street Journal.A beautifully written account of two generations in five Jewish families living in West and East Berlin, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland. Kaufman, a Pulitzer Prizewinning reporter for the Wall Street Journal and author of Broken Alliance: Turbulent Times Between Blacks and Jews in America (1988), organizes his accounts around two seminal events: the defeat of Nazi Germany and the fall of the Berlin Wall. He writes movingly about the many personal, cultural, and religious resonances of the Holocaust on Jewish life. One of his subjects is a Polish woman who was hidden by a Catholic family during the war, was raised to think of herself as an ``ordinary'' Pole, and learned almost by accident, and in her mid-30s, that she is Jewish. But Kaufman is particularly engrossing on the less well known and complex relationship between Eastern European Jewry and Communism. He provides a balanced account of how and why Jews were disproportionately represented in the leadership of most Eastern European countries; in 1949, for example, 7 of 13 members of the Hungarian Politburo were Jews, although Jews constituted only about one percent of the population. On the other hand, several of his subjects suffered physical and emotional torture under Stalin-like anti-Semitic purges, such as the Slansky trials in Czechoslovakia during the early 1950s. Kaufman seems by far the most engaged by, and offers the most detail on, his two families in West and East Berlin: respectively, a Holocaust survivor and his historian son, and a Communist party leader and his dissident son. And unlike so many accounts that depict Eastern Europe as a kind of extensive cemetery for Jewish life and culture, this book provides real, if modest, evidence of Jewish resilience and renewal. This is a work of exemplary journalistic research and narrative, one highly recommended for anyone interested in either contemporary Jewry or the new Europe. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Codswallop, says British-born Tracy Hogg. Having worked with more than five thousand babies over the past twenty years, and dubbed "The Baby Whisperer" by her grateful clientele, Tracy has the unique ability to understand a baby's every coo and cry. She can tell instantly whether a baby is hungry, tired, in real distress, or just in need of a little TLC. But her most amazing gift is her ability to teach parents how they too can "whisper" to their babies.<br><br>In this groundbreaking book, Tracy concentrates her vast knowledge (and huge doses of uncommon sense) into simple, accessible programs that parents can begin as early as the first weeks of a baby's life. With these programs you will learn<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;E.A.S.Y.--how to get baby to eat, play, and sleep on a schedule that will make every member of the household's life easier and happier.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;S.L.O.W.--how to interpret what your baby is trying to tell you (so you don't try to feed him when he really wants a nap).<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;How to identify which type of baby yours is--Angel, Textbook, Touchy, Spirited, or Grumpy--and then learn the best way to interact with that type.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracy's Three Day Magic--how to change any and all bad habits (yours and the baby's) in just three days.<br><br>But perhaps the most important part of Tracy's philosophy is contained in one word: respect. Tracy advises treating your baby as you would any human being--think twice before shaking loud toys in a baby's face, lifting a baby's legs over her head with no advance warning, or even letting a baby cry it out. At the heart of Tracy's simple but profound message: treat the baby as you would like to be treated yourself.<br><br>Reassuring, down-to-earth, and often flying in the face of conventional wisdom, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer promises parents not only a healthier, happier baby but a more relaxed and happy household as well.</p><p>The last thing new parents can find time for is quiet reading, so many helpful books on infant care rely on bullet points and a "let's get to the point" writing style. Tracy Hogg, a neonatal nurse, teacher, and mother of two, uses these techniques to good effect in <i>Secrets of the Baby Whisperer</i>. Focusing on newborns and their parents, her simple programs are a blend of intelligent intuition and methods based on years of experience. The first half of the book is devoted to E.A.S.Y--her name for creating a structured daily routine for you and your baby that makes the most of your baby's awake times and also leaves time just for you. These concepts aren't designed to force your bundle of joy into not following her body's needs, but rather to create a feasible middle ground between total rigidity and on-demand food and sleep (and no time for mom to shower). If it still strikes you as too regimented, keep reading. The author makes room for differences in personal style and includes short quizzes to determine whether you're a "planner" or a "winger", and what level of daily structure you are likely to find helpful. In the same chapter, she identifies five general temperaments of infants, how to get an accurate feel for yours, and what methods of care are likely to be the most effective for his temperament. Her statement that babies prefer routine is backed up by research from the University of Denver. While most of the book relies on anecdotes to get the points across, Hogg does find room to back up some of her statements with quotes from various researchers and institutions. Included at the end of the book are assurances that E.A.S.Y. can be followed even with a colicky baby or one who's been ruling the roost for the first few months. Frustrated parents might like to read the last page first: "all the baby-whispering advice in the world is useless unless you're having a good time being a parent" is an excellent reminder to enjoy this time with all of its ups and downs. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>Tracy Hogg obtained her nursing degree in England, specializing in maternity and neonatal care.

Following the lines of Neolithic standing stones, wading through floods and ruined fields, he walks Hadrian&#x2019;s Wall with soldiers who have fought in Afghanistan and visits the Buddhist monks who outnumber Christian monks in the Scottish countryside today. He melds the stories of the people he meets with the region&#x2019;s political and economic history, tracing the creation of Scotland from ancient tribes to the independence referendum. And he discovers another country buried in history, a vanished Middleland: the lost kingdom of Cumbria.<br><br> With every step, Stewart reveals the force of myths and traditions and the endurance of ties that are woven into the fabric of the land itself.

A first novel. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>The surprise winner of the 2003 Man Booker Prize, DBC Pierre's debut novel, <i>Vernon God Little</i>, makes few apologies in its darkly comedic portrait of Martirio, Texas, a town reeling in the aftermath of a horrific school shooting. Fifteen-year-old Vernon Little narrates the first-person story with a cynical twang and a four-letter barb for each of his diet-obsessed townsfolk. His mother, endlessly awaiting the delivery of a new refrigerator, seems to exist only to twist an emotional knife in his back; her friend, Palmyra, structures her life around the next meal at the Bar-B-Chew Barn; officer Vaine Gurie has Vernon convicted of the crime before she's begun the investigation; reporter Eulalio Ledesma hovers between a comforting father-figure and a sadistic Bond villain; and Jesus, his best friend in the world, is dead--a victim of the killings. As his life explodes before him, Vernon flees his home in pursuit of a tropical fantasy: a cabin on a beach in Mexico he once saw in the movie <i>Against All Odds</i>. But the police--and TV crews--are in hot pursuit. <p> <i>Vernon God Little</i> is a daring novel and demands a patient reader, not because it is challenging to read--Pierre's prose flows effortlessly, only occasionally slipping from the unmistakable voice of his hero--but because the book skates so precariously between the almost taboo subject of school violence and the literary gamesmanship of postmodern fiction. Yet, as the novel unfolds, Pierre's parodic version of American culture never crosses the line into caricature, even when it climaxes in a death-row reality TV show. And Vernon, whose cynicism and smart-ass "learnings" give way to a poignant curiosity about the meaning of life, becomes a fully human, profoundly sympathetic character. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>"If Huckleberry Finn were set on the Mexican-American border and written by the creators of South Park, it might read something like this."-San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>When sixteen kids are shot on high school grounds, everyone looks for someone to blame. Meet Vernon Little, under arrest at the sheriff's office, a teenager wearing nothing but yesterday's underwear and his prized logo sneakers. Moments after the shooter, his best buddy, turns the gun on himself, Vernon is pinned as an accomplice. Out for revenge are the townspeople, the cable news networks, and Deputy Vaine Gurie, a woman whose zeal for the Pritikin diet is eclipsed only by her appetite for barbecued ribs from the Bar-B-Chew Barn. So Vernon does what any red-blooded American teenager would do; he takes off for Mexico. <br> Vernon God Little is a provocatively satirical, riotously funny look at violence, materialism, and the American media. <br><br>Winner of the Whitbread Award for Best First Novel <br>A New York Times Notable Book <br>A San Francisco Chronicle Best Book of the Year <br><br>DBC Pierre is the pen name of Peter Finlay, who was born in Australia in 1961 and divided most of the first twenty-three years of his life between Texas and Mexico City.

This text weaves together evocative descriptions, history and myth (including flowers and festivals) with his personal reminiscences.</p><p>Lawrence Durrell was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St Edmund&#39;s School, Canterbury. His first literary work, The Black Book, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, A Private Country, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: Prospero&#39;s Cell, Reflections on a Marine Venus, about Rhodes, and Bitter Lemons, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell&#39;s wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, The Alexandria Quartet, which he completed in southern France where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the Quartet and The Avignon Quintet he wrote the two-decker Tunc and Nunquam. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps.

His seminal works include&nbsp;<i>Miracleman&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Watchmen</i>, for which he won the coveted Hugo Award. Never one to limit himself in form or content, Moore has also published novels,&nbsp;<i>Voice of the Fire&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Jerusalem</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;an epic poem,&nbsp;<i>The Mirror of Love.&nbsp;</i>Four of his ground-breaking graphic novels&#x2014;<i>From Hell</i>,&nbsp;<i>Watchmen</i>,&nbsp;<i>V for Vendetta</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>&#x2014;have been adapted to the silver screen. Moore currently resides in Northampton, England.A decade ago, Moore was the most critically acclaimed writer in comics and among the most prolific. In recent years, however, his output has largely been limited to occasional installments of his League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series, set in an alternate-reality Britain, where classic adventure fiction characters protect the empire. In this one, taking place 15 years after the events of Century: 1910 (2009), Janni Dakkar, the daughter of Jules Verne&#x2019;s Captain Nemo (also the Pirate Jenny of the Threepenny Opera), embarks on an Antarctic expedition, pursued by American inventors-heroes Frank Reade Jr. and Jack Swyfte (a homonymic namesake to a character who&#x2019;s not in the public domain), who are employed by a Hearstian newspaper tycoon named Kane. But neither team is prepared for the Lovecraftian horror that awaits them at the South Pole. O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s detailed, angular art brings the literary characters to vivid life and expertly captures the period atmosphere. Moore&#x2019;s playfully intelligent take on the boys&#x2019;-adventure genre serves as a reminder of just how much comics fans lost when he all but abandoned the medium. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Divided Highways: Building the Interstate Highways, Transforming American Life</h2><p>Provides a social, political, and technological history of the Interstate Highway System</p><p>Picture a field of dirt, piled knee high, that covers an area the size of Connecticut, or imagine a concrete sidewalk extending a million miles into space. You will have envisioned, Tom Lewis tells us, the amount of earth moved and the amount of concrete poured to make America's interstate highway system, a network of roads planned far back in the 19th century but completed only a few years ago. The public's view of the interstate system, Lewis writes, has been colored in recent decades by the grim realities of gridlock, smog, and road rage. In their early years, however, these highways seemed to promise the freedom of the open road, a gateway to faraway coasts. Lewis does a fine job of conveying the grandeur of the project, the largest work of civil construction ever undertaken by a democratic power.<p> Lewis's narrative is peopled with largely unknown figures, among them the little-heralded but critically important engineer Harris MacDonald. MacDonald turned the federal Bureau of Public Roads into a powerful force of social as well as physical engineering and paved the way for the large-scale projects of the Roosevelt and Eisenhower administrations. Lewis, a well-traveled explorer on the byways of technological progress, extends his history well into the past. He describes the building of the first national and post roads, the great parkways that connected such far-flung cities as Winnipeg and Miami, the once rural roads that, over the decades, blossomed into multilane highways--a process that has always depended on what Lewis calls "Americans' faith in technocracy" and their will to shape the future, acre by acre. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Tom Lewis is a professor of English at Skidmore College and an active documentary filmmaker.

This system is believed to predate the Nei Jing (Inner Classic) and was kept alive over the centuries in Shandong Province. When Dr. Tong was forced to move to Taiwan in 1949, he decided to break with family tradition and openly publish what had been till then jealously guarded family secrets. This clinically efficacious system is based on the use of 23 points per treatment. It contains the locations, indications, and needling instructions of this system&#39;s unique repertoire of points with extensive commentary and case histories on their use by the famous contemporary Californian acupuncturist, Miriam Lee. Lee has been using this system with excellent results for more than three decades.</p><p>We let this book go out of print for a couple of years because Miriam Lee had retired and no one was actively teaching this alternative system of acupuncture. However, in the last year or so, Richard Tan has begun offering seminars on this system throughout the United States. Therefore, due to the repeated requests of Dr. Tan&#39;s many students, we decided to put this book back into print. Happily, Dr. Tan graciously consented to write a Preface for this new edition.Tong Jing-chang was born into a family of acupuncturists in Shandong Province, China sometime near the beginning of this century. His family passed down a lineage of acupuncture purported to have originated before Qin Huang-di's burning of the books 2,200 years ago. The hallmarks of this family style are the use of a very few points per treatment, an emphasis on contralateral needling of one- sided pathologies, sophisticated five phase concepts, and a simple yet profound system of diagnosis. <p>Although many of the points described in this book are the same as in contemporary TCM acupuncture, they are not arranged by channels and they have different names. Many of these points are unique, extra-channel points not catalogued in current Chinese usage. These points can be extremely effective in clinical practice. Dr. Tong was regarded as one of the most famous and effective acupuncturists in Taiwan and Southeast Asia and his many students continue to keep this style alive in Taiwan. </p><p>In the 1970s, Miriam Lee, OMD, brought this style to the United States where she has gained the reputation of one of the most effective acupuncturists on the West Coast. Over the years, she has taught hundreds of acupuncturists this system. Now, for the first time, Dr. Tong's book of acupuncture is available in English supplemented by Dr. Lee's copious commentary and case histories. Acupuncturists of all styles will find this book both thought-provoking and clinically useful.</p></p><h2>Wodehouse On Crime</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

The man he has been ordered to seize could be the witness that will destroy Sejanus, commander of the Praetorian Guard, and ruler of the Empire in all but name. Before he completes his mission, Vespasian will face ambush in snowbound mountains, pirates on the high seas, and Sejanus's spies all around him. But by far the greatest danger lies at the rotten heart of the Empire, at the nightmarish court of Tiberius, Emperor of Rome and debauched, paranoid madman.</p></p><p><b>Robert Fabbri</b> has worked in film and TV for 25 years.

A tiny backyard patio was gracefully shaded by a majestic Aleppo pine tree, and Ondine sat on a low stone wall that rimmed the tree. Wielding a confident knife, she diligently pared and sorted Provence&#x2019;s springtime treasures&#x2014;�baby carrots, peas and artichokes so tender they could be served raw, topped by thinly sliced lemons sweet enough to eat with their rinds on.&nbsp;<br><br>She was working briskly and a delicate sheen of sweat made her sensitive to that sudden change in the wind as it rustled significantly through the pine tree&#x2019;s branches. Because Ondine had been raised to believe in nature&#x2019;s auspicious signs and warnings, she put down her knife, closed her eyes and lifted her head to greet the breeze as it skimmed across her face with an invigorating whiff of the sea.&nbsp;<br><br>She seldom got a quiet moment alone like this to think her own thoughts. So when a hazy premonition of a more exciting future somewhere far away began to shape itself in her mind, she struggled to capture it, as if reaching to grasp a firefly before the light disappeared.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ondine!&#x201d; her mother shouted from the caf�&#x2019;s kitchen. &#x201c;Where is she? On-�dine!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine flinched as she heard her name reverberating against the huddle of pale stone buildings. She glanced up, and saw her mother&#x2019;s head framed by the window like a portrait of a formidable empress. Even though it was too late for breakfast and too early for the lunch service, there was never a lull in cooking chores to do in order to meet the caf�&#x2019;s high standards.&nbsp;<br><br>Everyone who worked in the Caf� Paradis knew his role, right down to the striped cat who patrolled for any mouse foolhardy enough to come near the kitchen, and the bulldog who stood guard against tramps skulking about for an easy handout or an unlocked window. As for Ondine, who was seventeen now, her job was to do whatever her mother told her.&nbsp;<br><br>Madame Belange peered out the kitchen window and finally spied her daughter. &#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing, lounging there in the garden like a pasha?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just finishing up, Maman!&#x201d; Ondine called, rising hastily and hoisting her vegetable basket on her hip as she hurried to the kitchen. By now the fortuitous wind had gone off on its inscrutable way without her. In its place came the usual busy odors of kitchen oil and truck fuel and wood-�burning from the farmers&#x2019; fields. Still, there was definitely a whiff of something special in the air today&#x2014;�her parents had been acting oddly all morning, murmuring to each other in hushed tones.&nbsp;<br><br>As she drew closer to the open kitchen window, Ondine&#x2019;s discerning nose picked up the first scents of the day&#x2019;s luncheon menu: onion-�and-�black-�olive tartes called pissaladi�re; a pork stew of red wine and myrtle; and, for the fish&#x2014;�could it be . . . ?&nbsp;<br><br>She burst inside and went straight to the old black stove seething in its corner with the collected heat of decades of well-�cooked meals. The fragrance wafting from a big kettle was unmistakable now.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Bouillabaisse!&#x201d; she exclaimed, wondering why her mother had chosen this special dish&#x2014;�which required a half-�dozen kinds of fish&#x2014;�instead of making a simpler and less expensive fish soup called bourride. Ondine lifted the pot&#x2019;s lid and inhaled rapturously. Celery, onion, garlic, tomato, fennel, pepper, parsley, thyme, bay and the distinctive orange rind used in the South of France; and something else especially rare and precious, which turned the broth to the color of gold.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you use P�re Jacques&#x2019; saffron today?&#x201d; Ondine asked, impressed.&nbsp;<br><br>Her busy mother glanced up and actually paused for a moment. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Madame Belange said, reaching for a tiny glass vial which she held up to the light and examined reverently. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s the last of it, all except this one strand which I could not bear to lose.&#x201d; Mother and daughter exchanged a look of awe as they gazed at the red thread of saffron, which imparted a mysterious taste that the old monk P�re Jacques described as a kiss between fresh-�mown hay and chestnut honey.&nbsp;<br><br>P�re Jacques had given this homegrown saffron to Ondine when she graduated from a convent boarding school in the hills above Nice. The meditative old monk who ran the abbey&#x2019;s kitchen was one of those rare elders that appreciated Ondine&#x2019;s curiosity instead of being irritated by it. Knowing that her family ran a caf�, he&#x2019;d allowed her to escape the usual convent chores to assist him in his calm, contemplative gardens, learning his ancient secrets of cuisine.&nbsp;<br><br>There is nothing on earth like French saffron, he&#x2019;d said proudly, showing her his field of mauve-�colored crocuses which he patiently tended until two rare days in October when they bloomed. Then, all the monks pitched in to pluck the delicate red pistils&#x2014;�only three per flower&#x2014;�which, when carefully dried, became those prized red threads that P�re Jacques put into glass vials. Ondine and her mother doled out these strands of saffron to make them last, using them only for special occasions, like Christmas custards and macarons.<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on today?&#x201d; Ondine asked, intrigued.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;We have an important new customer for lunch,&#x201d; her mother answered distractedly.&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine dipped a spoon to taste the bouillabaisse. &#x201c;Mmm. Wonderful! But, it could use more pepper,&#x201d; she suggested.<br><br>Madame Belange shook her head and said crisply, &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s fine as it is. I&#x2019;d rather err on the side of caution today.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine felt a wave of sympathy for her mother, who, unlike P�re Jacques, functioned as if on a knife&#x2019;s-�edge, her nerves taut as she constantly battled against time, supplies and cost, with scarcely a franc or a moment to spare. But despite her request for help, Madame Belange kept nudging her daughter out of the way impatiently, as if it were obvious that this small, cramped kitchen didn&#x2019;t really have room for two grown women.&nbsp;<br><br>Raising a flour-�dusted wrist to push aside a stray lock of hair, Madame Belange said, &#x201c;Vite, vite, get to work!&#x201d; But then she cried out warningly, &#x201c;Attention!&#x201d; as the back door was flung open by a local dairy boy who barreled in with a large crate of eggs, cheese and cream. Ondine ducked out of the way just in time.&nbsp;<br><br>While her mother paid the boy, Ondine unpacked his crate onto an enormous table in the center of the room. She&#x2019;d been awake since dawn, first to make hot chocolate for the quick breakfast she shared with her parents, then to serve the morning customers their brioche and coffee. After that, she got the stocks simmering gently on the stove before she went outside to pare her vegetables; now it was time to assemble all the salads for the lunch service.<br><br>Yet apparently her mother had much more unusual plans for Ondine today.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Just make one perfect salad, fit for our new Patron,&#x201d; Madame Belange commanded. &#x201c;And write down every ingredient we&#x2019;ve used in today&#x2019;s lunch for our records.&#x201d; With her hip she pushed a cupboard drawer shut. &#x201c;This man will be a regular customer, so we don&#x2019;t want to give him the same lunches again and again. Make notes, tout de suite&#x2014;�and put that convent schooling of yours to some real use!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine reached up to a shelf for one of the blank notebooks they used for such occasions&#x2014;�bound in butter-�soft maroon leather, they&#x2019;d been a gift from a stationer who ate his lunch at the caf� three times a week. She turned to the first page, which had a printed box framed by an illustration of bunched grapes on a twirling vine. Inside the box was a line designated for filling in a Nom. She imagined that this new Patron must be some rich banker or lawyer.&nbsp;<br><br>She paused. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his name?&#x201d; she asked curiously.<br><br>Her mother waved a ladle indifferently. &#x201c;Who knows? He&#x2019;s got money, that&#x2019;s all that matters!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>So Ondine simply wrote a large P for Patron. Then she turned to the next page and wrote 2 April 1936 at the top before she recorded today&#x2019;s meal, checking on which ingredients were used and how they were cooked. Her mother kept such records only for distinguished customers, and special events like catered meals or wedding banquets. Later she would add comments about the Patron&#x2019;s personal preferences and how the recipe might be better tailored to him.&nbsp;<br><br>Madame Belange looked up from the stove and said resolutely, &#x201c;All right now. Put away the notebook and let&#x2019;s pack up this meal!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Pack it?&#x201d; Ondine echoed in surprise.&nbsp;<br><br>Her mother wore an especially sober expression. &#x201c;This man has rented one of the villas at the top of the hill. Here&#x2019;s the address,&#x201d; she said, digging in her pocket for a scrap of paper and handing it to her. &#x201c;You will use your bicycle to bring him his lunch every weekday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What am I, a donkey?&#x201d; Ondine demanded indignantly. &#x201c;Since when do we deliver lunch to people&#x2019;s houses? Who is this man, that he can&#x2019;t come to the caf� to eat his lunch like everybody else?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Madame Belange said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s someone tr�s c�l�bre from Paris. He speaks French, but I&#x2019;m told he&#x2019;s a Spaniard. The nuns taught you Spanish at the convent, yes?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;A little,&#x201d; Ondine answered warily.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it might finally come in handy.&#x201d; Her mother glanced around decisively. &#x201c;Get me that nice striped pitcher for the wine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s your favorite!&#x201d; Ondine objected. Besides, the tall, hand-�painted pink-�and-�blue pitcher had been promised to her for her wedding trousseau&#x2014;�if she ever made it to the altar. Her unsentimental mother shrugged. Ondine muttered, &#x201c;I hope this fancy Spaniard appreciates it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>She had to move swiftly now; the meal was coming together quickly. They packed the lunch into an insulated metal hamper, wrapping each dish tightly in red-�and-�white cloths. Then Ondine went into the basement to an oaken barrel of house wine, from which she siphoned off enough white wine to fill a bladder made of pigskin which she brought upstairs. Madame Belange ordered one of the waiters to carry the hamper outside and securely clip it to the metal basket on Ondine&#x2019;s bicycle.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Alors! Listen carefully.&#x201d; Her mother fixed her with a stern look. &#x201c;You are to enter the Patron&#x2019;s house from the side door, which he will leave unlocked for you. Go straight into the kitchen. Heat up the food and lay it out for him. Then leave, right away. Do not wait for him to come downstairs to eat.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Madame Belange pinched her daughter on the arm. &#x201c;Do you hear me, Ondine?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; Ondine protested. She&#x2019;d been listening attentively and felt she didn&#x2019;t deserve that. But her exhausted mother sometimes just ran out of words, and punctuated the urgency of her commands with a quick slap if anyone in her kitchen asked too many questions. Madame Belange, in her own youth, had never witnessed mothers and daughters having the luxury of time to indulge in searching, philosophical chats. Children were like baby chicks whom one loved the way a mother hen did&#x2014;�you fed them, kept them warm, taught them how to fend for themselves, and pecked them with a nudge in the right direction whenever they wandered astray.<br><br>Madame Belange repeated, &#x201c;Go in quietly, prepare the food, lay it out, and leave. Do not call out to him or make noise. Later, you&#x2019;ll go collect the dishes, without making a sound.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine had a terrible urge to burst out laughing at these absurd orders to skulk around like a thief. But her mother was so very serious that Ondine recognized the weight of her responsibility.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I understand, Maman,&#x201d; she said, although her curiosity was thoroughly piqued now.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Take the daffodils from the dining room with you. Afterwards, on your way home, stop by the market to buy new flowers for the caf�,&#x201d; her mother said in a low voice, digging into her apron pocket for a few coins. &#x201c;Here.&#x201d; Then, with her elbow, she gave her daughter a shove. &#x201c;Go!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine dutifully went through the swinging doors that led to the formal dining room, which was reserved for the night meal only. Breakfast and lunch were always served outside on the front terrace, rain or shine, since there was a sturdy white-�and-�grey awning that could be cranked overhead and withstood most bad weather.<br><br>The Caf� Paradis occupied the first floor of a limestone house that was the color of a honey praline. Ondine&#x2019;s family lived in the rooms above the caf�. The second floor had a master bedroom for her parents, and a smaller bedroom for occasional overnight lodgers. Her two older brothers once occupied that guest room, but both were killed in the Great War and now slumbered in the town cemetery, near their infant siblings who&#x2019;d been lost to scarlet fever before Ondine was born. The third and topmost floor had only one slope-�roofed room, originally made for servants, where Ondine had slept all her life.</p><h2>Dear Professor Einstein: Albert Einstein&#39;s Letters to and from Children</h2><p>Title: Dear Prof. Einstein( Albert Einstein's Letters to and from Children) &lt;&gt;Binding: Hardcover &lt;&gt;Author: AliceCalaprice &lt;&gt;Publisher: PrometheusBooks</p><p></p><h2>Book of Mormon Authorship Revisited: The Evidence for Ancient Origins</h2><p>Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints view the Book of Mormon as scripture written by ancient prophets, while critics believe that it is a 19th-century fraud.

After attending NYU on an athletic scholarship, he worked in magazine publishing, and soon started a series of publications that included <i>Gentry</i> and <i>American Textiles</i>, and in that capacity met such notables as D. T. Suzuki, P. D. Ouspensky, and G.I. Gurdjieff. An acclaimed painter, he had several gallery exhibitions, including a 1999 retrospective at the Tibet House in New York City. He died in 2000 at the age of ninety-six.In recent years, there has been a stream of books that use a blend of ancient Buddhist truths and common sense to show busy Americans how they can open an "inner door," as the Dalai Lama expresses it. How intrigued the Dalai Lama would be to read this posthumous autobiography of William Segal. Surpassing any effort at practical or everyday spirituality in recent memory, this beautiful work shows what it means to live, as Segal called it, a "double life." Segal was, judging by this record, a gifted athlete, a tough and independent businessman, an accomplished artist-a true rugged individualist. Yet his whole, rich, varied career reportedly was suffused with an inner stillness, an openness and meaning, that came from a deep, lifelong spiritual practice. Pulled together by Segal's wife, Bancou-Segal, with the help of editor Magill, this memoir is a kind of gorgeous scrapbook that includes paintings, photographs, articles, diary entries and correspondence with artists, thinkers, businessmen and great spiritual teachers. "Bill was a man of many layers and if the outer layer was the man of today, the innermost core was an opening to eternity," writes one good friend, theater director Peter Brook, in a preface. Born in Macon, Ga., in 1904 to poor Romanian Jewish immigrant parents, Segal was an archetypal American success story. A football hero at New York University, he became the innovative publisher of 11 magazines, including the ground-breaking Gentry. He was also, among other things, a painter, writer and editor, an important promoter of trade with Japan and a connoisseur of art, wine, fashion and life. Above all, however, Segal was a seeker of truth-first as a student of P.D. Ouspensky and G.I. Gurdjieff and, later, D.T. Suzuki. By the end of his life at 96, he appears to have become a living embodiment of the Zen image of "the old man in the marketplace," conveying by his presence alone a sense of the wonder hidden within ordinary things. By all accounts soft-spoken and gracefully deliberate, Segal was, as the Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman writes in his foreword, a "quiet harbinger of enlightenment in the West." Bancou-Segal describes Segal as an "avant-garde American of the Twentieth Century," and this book does seem especially timely and important now. It reveals what we can really make of our lives in a society that cherishes the individual. Segal offers brilliant proof that our proverbial drive and ingenuity can be used for something greater than material gain, that our freedom can take us all the way to liberation. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chaos in Gotham City (The LEGO Batman Movie: Activity Book with Minfigure)</h2><p>An awesome, all-new activity book based on the LEGO(R) Batman Movie(TM).

Meeting the patient sets off an alarm inside her, but fleeing the house is impossible. The redoubtable red-haired nurse is stuck there with a strange coterie and a black cat named Genevieve. Originally published in 1930, a year after her debut mystery novel <i>The Patient in Room 18</i>, <i>While the Patient Slept</i> strengthened Mignon G. Eberhart's hold on fame.</p><p>In a career spanning more than a half century&nbsp;Mignon G. Eberhart&nbsp;has acquired a legion of readers for such well-crafted, atmospheric mysteries as <i>The White Cockatoo</i>, <i>From This Dark Stairway</i>, <i>The Chiffon Scarf</i>, and <i>Woman on the Roof.</i>Though female sleuths are the rage today, Eberhart broke new ground with the introduction of Nurse Sarah Keate in The Patient in Room 18 in 1929. A year later, as Agatha Christie's Miss Jane Marple made her debut, Eberhart published While the Patient Slept, and she and Nurse Keate were catapulted to fame. Sarah, ``an old maid'' with a ``lively and inquiring mind,'' has a knack for murder and mayhem. Hired to care for the comatose patriarch of the reclusive Federie clan, she is immediately struck by the gloom and doom of the old manse and its mysterious occupants. The first murder occurs within feet of a dozing Sarah, and a second leaves ``the respectable and respected spinster'' shaken. Enter police detective Lance O'Leary, the perfect foil for Sarah's acerbic wit and derring-do. Though the language is often dated and readers will catch on before Sarah, Eberhart's timing and gothic atmosphere are second to none. As the suspense steadily builds, Federie House's darkness and decay seep from the pages until the satisfying denouement. Though Sarah may not be as quick as today's pistol-packing feminists, her return is a welcome addition to the distinguished ranks of other silver-streaked gumshoes. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works</h2><p>MAKE A SOUND INVESTMENT IN CLASSICAL MUSIC<br>Who are the ten most important classical composers?

MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald&#39;s writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be &#39;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller&#39;. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.</p><h2>Midnight Guardians (Max Freeman Mysteries)</h2><p><p><b><i>The thrilling new Max Freeman mystery - </i></b>When private eye Max Freeman is hired to investigate a conspiracy involving fake claims to Medicare, he quickly realizes the scheme is much more dangerous than anyone assumed.

Why anyone aspired to preside over the ruins is less a mystery after reading Read. From the unpromising beginnings of Nazism in the 1920s, ambitious misfits gathered around Hitler, whose demagogic genius in exploiting the humiliation of WWI's defeat seemed likely to propel him to power. Each was, in Read's words, "totally besotted" with Hitler and "bitterly jealous" of his attention to others. Not all survived the Darwinian struggle for favor and succession. Ernst Rhm was murdered by fellow Nazis. Rudolf Hess took a solo flight to captivity. Reinhard Heydrich was assassinated. But three of the original disciples-Hermann Gring, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler-remained to the end, competing for power even when, with defeat imminent, the prize had lost all value. Four latecomers also hung on for dubious glory: the foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop; chief architect and war production genius, Albert Speer; Hitler's private secretary, Martin Bormann; and Adm. Karl Dnitz, whom no one expected to be anointed Hitler's successor. That the internecine rivalries persisted beyond the end suggests the warped minds of Hitler's crew of bureaucratic criminals. Despite his penchant for cliche ("the ripest of plums suddenly dropped into the Nazis' laps, completely out of the blue"), Read (coauthor of The Fall of Berlin, etc.) tells the story of two decades of assiduous jockeying for power in luridly absorbing if overwhelming detail. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Subjects covered include mythological motifs of classical gods and goddesses, religious subjects and scenes, and the ever-present anonymous woman. A history of the cameo is provided, followed by individual chapters covering each of the materials used to make cameos, including amber, amethyst, glass, jasper ware, lava, mother-of-pearl, opal, plastics, quartz, shell, topaz, and Wedgwood. The beautiful, detailed photographs show the unique artistry and design of the cameos and their settings.

Patricia Rosser Clements is a longtime antiques collector whose other interests include art, design and photography.Cameos were originally carved out of single multilayered stones, but since the 18th-century "classical" period, lava, shell, glass, plastics, and other materials have been used. This general history is very briefly told in Cameos, which at its best is a visual feast for enthusiasts of this type of jewelry. Over 1400 pieces are pictured in full color, though occasionally the illustrations are unclear owing to the small size of the items or shadows on detail. Accompanying captions state materials, dates, sizes, and prices. Information is gleaned from antique dealers and collectors?presumably acquaintances of the authors, who are also dealers?but not from curators. Readers are thus advised to consult experts, refer to other publications, and examine actual pieces to gain familiarity with variations in quality and authenticity. This book can offer a broad first exposure to acquaint beginning collectors of cameos, but, given its price, it is best suited to large public libraries.?Therese Duzinkiewicz Baker, Western Kentucky Univ.

Exploring key examples in popular culture ranging from Peter Sellers' portrayal of Hrundi Bakshi in the 1968 film <i>The Party</i> to contemporary representations such as Apu from <i>The Simpsons</i> and characters in <i>Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle</i>, Shilpa S. Dave develops the ideas of "accent," "brownface," and "brown voice" as new ways to explore the racialization of South Asians beyond just visual appearance. Dave relates these examples to earlier scholarship on blackface, race, and performance to show how "accents" are a means of representing racial difference, national origin, and belonging, as well as distinctions of class and privilege. While focusing on racial impersonations in mainstream film and television, <i>Indian Accents</i> also amplifies the work of South Asian American actors who push back against brown voice performances, showing how strategic use of accent can expand and challenge such narrow stereotypes.</p><p><b>Shilpa S. Dave</b> is is Assistant Dean, College of Arts and Sciences, and an assistant professor of media studies and American studies at University of Virginia."A truly innovative use of 'accents' as a methodological entry into understanding where South Asians are positioned within America and American popular culture. Persuasively argued and full of many sharp insightful moments, <i>Indian Accents</i> will be invaluable to scholars of American studies, Asian American studies, ethnic studies, and media studies." --Gita Rajan, coeditor of <i>New Cosmopolitanisms: South Asians in the U.S</i><br><br> "Dav� brilliantly studies the racialized, classed, and nationalistic codes of Orientalist and model minority representations with an underwriting analysis of heteronormative masculinity... Dav� does crucial critical work in diasporic visual culture."--<i>Asian Diasporic Visual Cultures and the Americas</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br><p> &nbsp;</p><p> "This book offers a much needed corrective to the portrayal of South Asian masculinity in American popular culture and is, therefore, a valuable addition to the field."--<i>American Studies</i></p><p></p><p></p><br><br>"Shilpa Dav� was able to capture the multidimensional elements of representations of people of color that go beyond visual markers of identification but also include sonic components to ethnic characters in media. Her innovative application of the double meaning of the word 'accent' opens a new level of analysis of ethnic representation in film and media studies and ethnic studies." --<i>Journal of Asian American Studies</i><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Mouse and the Motorcycle, Special Read-Aloud Edition</h2><p>Used.

Freeman, who designed and built his own greenhouse, begins with chapters on types of greenhouses, equipment, soil, air, water, heat, light, pests, and diseases. The rest of the book covers growing seedlings for transplanting into the outdoor garden and raising vegetables and herbs in the greenhouse. Freeman lists vegetable, flower, and herb species suitable for growing to maturity in a greenhouse. He also touches on growing houseplants and cut flowers, but specialty plants like orchids and African violets are beyond the scope of the book.

As a psychotherapist and researcher, Lawrence LeShan is more interested in the process and effects of meditation than the spiritual motivations. To LeShan, meditation means training the mind, and he likens it to physical exercise. Like a good trainer, he breaks down the different kinds of meditation into easy-to-learn steps and offers counsel about the best ways to go about it and the pitfalls you are likely to encounter. LeShan isn't pure vanilla, however. He wrote at a time (the early '70s) when meditation was still considered esoteric and strongly associated with the paranormal. Still, he keeps his feet on the ground and suggests that you do, too. Meditation, he says, helps get a new perspective on the world and to attain "an increased serenity and competence in being." If you are a beginning meditator, this perennial favorite is a good place to start. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>This simple, straightforward yet powerful guide has ready helped hundreds of thousands of people reap the greatest rewards of meditation.

However, he also knows his way around boats and has an old friend living free and easy in the Florida Keys.

His family's fate continues to haunt him, however, and he sifts through his memories to try to make sense of his loss. Finally, in the late 1930s, he returns to Shanghai to solve the most important case of his life. But as Christopher pursues his investigation, the boundaries between fact and fantasy begin to evaporate. Is the Japanese soldier he meets really Akira? Are his parents really being held in a house in the Chinese district? And who is Mr. Grayson, the British official who seems to be planning an important celebration? "My first question, sir, before anything else, is if you're happy with the choice of Jessfield Park for the ceremony? We will, you see, require substantial space."</p><p> In <i>When We Were Orphans</i> Kazuo Ishiguro uses the conventions of crime fiction to create a moving portrait of a troubled mind, and of a man who cannot escape the long shadows cast by childhood trauma. Sherlock Holmes needed only fragments--a muddy shoe, cigarette ash on a sleeve--to make his deductions, but all Christopher has are fading recollections of long-ago events, and for him the truth is much harder to grasp. Ishiguro writes in the first person, but from the beginning there are cracks in Christopher's carefully restrained prose, suggestions that his version of the world may not be the most reliable. Faced with such a narrator, the reader is forced to become a detective too, chasing crumbs of truth through the labyrinth of Christopher's memory. </p><p> Ishiguro has never been one for verbal pyrotechnics, but the unruffled surface of this haunting novel only adds to its emotional power. <i>When We Were Orphans</i> is an extraordinary feat of sustained, perfectly controlled imagination, and in Christopher Banks the author has created one of his most memorable characters. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>In Our Humble Opinion: Car Talk&#39;s Click and Clack Rant and Rave</h2><p>The hosts of NPR&#39;s popular non-news radio show share a collection of their original observations, rants, musings, and declarations, on topics ranging from computer and coffee culture to politics and Hollywood, in a series of brief but pithy essays.

Her age falls exactly between the wide-eyed times when fairy tales are embraced as truth and the darker, later years when cynicism starts to take its toll.

Trout was named after one of her father&#39;s biggest passions and, according to her, she was only three numbers from being christened Powerball. Trout tries to temper Agnes&#39;s stigmatism of hope with her own doctrine of realism. Together they weather the major tribulations that only childhood can make so monumental. Trout aspires to pilot a soft-serve ice cream machine so all the kids will laugh and yell &#34;Hey, Ice Cream Lady!&#34; Agnes merely wants to be crowned lord queen of the unknown universe.
